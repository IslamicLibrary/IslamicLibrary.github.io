    Grading: It was declared 'Muwaṯhaq' by Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi.
    Ibn Hajar tasfir

    As for a woman who was jealous of a Prophet in whom jealousy is proven, and her sexual affair is not denounced,
    she is one of the virtuous women, as well as those who are less than them, and that Aisha was jealous of the Prophet’s
    wives, but she was more jealous of Khadija.

    Ibn hajar said:

    Jealousy is forgiven for women for what happens in it, and there is no punishment for them in that case,
    for what they were inclined to do, and that is why the Prophet, saw did not rebuke Aisha from that.
