    Necrophilia in Hinduism

    Shiva had sex with his dead wife, Sati.
    Brahmanda Purana 2.6-10:
    "Pieces of the dead body of Hindu goddess Sati fall everywhere on earth, and Shiva finds her vagina at Kamarupa and puts his penis into it."

     "Lamenting thus and afflicted with grief, he held the dead body of his beloved wife to his breast and kissed and embraced it again and again." Siva pressed his lips to the lips of his beloved, embracing her and swooning again.

    Brahma also had sex with a dead body in a cremation ground. His son Salliyan was born from this necrophilia.

    Pandits Aghori practise necrophilia with the dead; it's a common ritual.

    The Aghori seek to satisfy the needs of Goddess Kali through cannibalism and sex with corpses.

    A brahmin pandit sacrifices a 7-year-old girl, eats her liver, and has sex with her corpse.

    These rapists (brahmin necrophilia ) are in devotion to Kali.
     Kali is portrayed in traditional art as having snake-like tongues and bloody fangs, as well as having slain and consumed people. She is shown sporting a necklace made of severed human heads that is covered in blood.
