    Destroying the Logic of Veganism


    If us killing animals are bad because of their suffering, then why wouldn't the same thing apply to other animals? Animals harm each other, even when they don't even have to in many cases. If us killing an animal is murder, why wouldn't the same thing apply to other animals killing each other, or other animals killing us?

    If the reason is that humans are exceptional, and so we have to hold ourselves to a "higher standard", then this conflicts with the idea that all suffering has to be treated the same, because humans would be higher than animals due to our "superior mind".

    If killing animals is immoral, then humans eating animals is humans killing murderers and eating them.

    Also, if we are all animals, then there's also no reason to hold ourselves to a different standard.

    P1: Humans are animals

    P2: Animals kill themselves

    Conclusion:
    Humans kill animals

    It's just nature. There's no reason to treat ourselves any different
