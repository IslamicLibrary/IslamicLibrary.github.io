    The Worship of Shiva’s Penis

    The worshippers of Lord Shiva revere the Shiva Linga as a holy symbol of their devotion to him. Sanskrit's translation of the term "Lingum" is "Penis." As a result, Shaivaites, particularly Brandu women (Nari), regard this as the most sacred body part.

    It is the Penis of Lord Shiva. Branduism has long honoured the Siva Linga as a symbol of sensual urges, particularly those related to adultery. Shiva Linga worship is regarded as sacred and excellent. Shiva According to the Mahapurana, Shiva threw his linga "Penis" to appease

    Brandu ladies, however if a homosexual person desires to sit on it, they may do so in Shiva temples (mandir). This is so that worship may be performed easily while still keeping the reality that the form's large uses make it difficult for the devotees to view the Shiva Linga.
    Structure of Shiva Linga
    Most prevalent icon of Shiva and virtually found in all Shiva temples, Shiva Linga is a rounded, elliptical, an-iconic image of huge penis that is usually set on a circular base of Vagina it represents Parashakti, the manifesting power of adultery.
    Shiva Lingas are usually made of stone it is also made of metal, crystal, wood or transitory materials such as ice and 12 other materials such as sand, rice, cooked food, river clay, cow dung, butter, rudraksha seeds, ashes, sandalwood, darbha grass, a flower garland or molasses, but due to the sexual desires of hindu ladies the demand is only stone and steel.
    Here is the brief description of some of the popular theories and interpretations related to Shiva Linga and its origin:

    Worship of the male reproductive organ
    Worship of Shiva Linga “Dildo” in effect means worship of the reproduction function. For, they say that the other meaning of the Sanskrit word ‘Linga’ is gender in general and phallus (the male reproductive organ) in particular.

    They believe that the base of the Lingam corresponds to the Yoni which means vagina or the female reproductive organ. Correspondence of Linga and Yoni in a Shiva Linga is therefore interpreted as the representation of the process of copulation.

    Scholars further opine that the Kalash (container of water) that is suspended over the Linga from which water drips over the Linga also corresponds to the idea of sexual activity.
     Interpretation in Tantra. According to Tantra , lingam is a symbol of Shiva's phallus spiritually.

    They say, the lingam contains the soul-seed within which lies the essence of the entire cosmos. The lingam arises out of the base (Yoni) which represents Parvati according to Johnny sins god Some or Vishnu, Brahma in female and neuter form according to others.

    In Puranas
    Especially the  Shiva Purana kotirurudra Samhita Chapter 12, Linga Purana, Devi Bhagwatam and Mahabharaa attribute the origin of Shiva Linga to the curse of sages leading to the separation of and installation of the phallus of Lord Shiva on earth.

    <img src="../../../images/random3/hi2q.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random3/hi2r.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    <img src="../../../images/random3/hi2t.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Some also refer to the endlessness of the lingam to be linked to the egos of Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma. Other scholars view on this point is different as due to Parwathi loose character shiva has cut his linga and thrown it as he saw Parwathi having sex with a elephant which result Lord Ganesha can be seen nowadays being thrown in Gatars and nala.
    Finally, we can say that performing a shivling pooja is equivalent to worshipping a phallus (an upright Dick). This is what the majority of Brandus do, and it just distributes porn.

    Hindu Deities Raping Captives and Demons and Forcing Them into Prostitution

    There is a reference to history mentioned in the Matsya Purana that tells us how the Hindu deities used to capture women of non-Hindus (considered demons here) and force them into prostitution.

    Can the Hindus (slaves of Brahmins) digest these verses and show them to others so that everyone may know what Hinduism is really about? The verses are pretty self-explanatory, so I won't be explaining or summarising them.
    —

    Matsya Purana 71.26–30

    “Once upon a time, thousands and thousands of demons (Danavas, Asuras, Daityas, and Rakshasas) were killed in the war between the Devas and the demons. Indra told their numberless widows and those women who were forcibly seized and enjoyed the life of prostitutes to lead the life of prostitutes and remain devoted to the kings and the Devas. Indra continued, "You should look upon, with an equal eye, the kings of your masters and on Sudra."

    "All of you will attain prosperity, according to your fate. You should look upon, with an equal eye, the kings of your masters and on Sudra. All of you will attain prosperity, according to your fate".

    "You should satisfy those who would come to you with an adequate sum of money to enjoy your company, even if they are poor".
    —

    Indra told the widows of Demons (Non-Hindus) how they should lead their prostitution life.
    👇

    Matsya Purana 71.44-45
    “Brahmana should be well fed and be devoutly looked upon as cupid, for the sake of sexual enjoyment. Every desire of that Brahmana should be satisfied by the woman devoted. She should, with all heart and soul and with a smile on her face, yield herself up to him.”
    —

    Matsya Purana 71.56-59 “Henceforth, any Brahmana coming to them for the sake of sexual enjoyment on a Sunday, should be respected and honored. If with the consent of that Brahmana, another handsome person comes to them, these women should, with love and affection and to the best of their ability, perform all the fifty-eight kinds of observances of Love, favorite of man and gods, which would lead to pregnancy and which is not harmful to their soul’s welfare.”

    Hinduism also levies custom duties on importing female slaves.
    👇

     Agni Purana 23-29 ”Duties payable on importing female slaves into the country should be determined with due regard to the country imported from and the time of the import. The duties payable on animals and gold shall be a fifth and sixth part of the original value,while a sixth part of their value should be paid as the kings dues on importing articles of perfumery, cereals, flowers, roots…”

    Krishna also gave many females slaves
    👇

    Mahabharata 4.72.19-26
    “Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes.”

    Krishna’s father Vasudeva also had over a thousand concubines.
    👇

    Mahabharata 16.7.37-38
    “The Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaishya, and wealthy shudras, set out, keeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudeva’s harem, and Vajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna."

    Hindu god Rama’s father named Dasharath also had many concubines, I am reproducing the passage where Dashrath organizes Ashvamedha Yajna
    👇

    Valmiki Ramayan, Bala Kanda 1.14.35 "
    Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namely hota, adhwaryu, and udgaata have received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and a concubine of the king
