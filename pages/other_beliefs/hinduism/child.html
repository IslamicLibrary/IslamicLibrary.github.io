    Refuting the Argument that Hindu Child Marriage Doesn’t Necessarily Include Consummation

    Some modern Hindus claim that Marriage isn't consummation in Hinduism.

    This is again a lie.

    Here is the Garbhadan sanskara explained by a Hindu nationalist, therefore a husband should have intercourse with his wife after appearance of first menses.

    <img src="../../../images/random2/hizz1.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Intercourse after first menstruation is compulsory in Hinduism.

    Manusmriti 9.4 "censurable is the father who does not marry her and censurable is the husband who approaches her not"

    Medhatithi mentions : ‘Who does not approach her’-Who does not have intercourse with her.

    <img src="../../../images/random2/hizz2.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Intercourse is also compulsory.
    Baudhyana Dharmasutra 4.1.21-22 "Husband who doesn't have intercourse with his wife after her menstruation commits sin, a wife who rejects husband advancements should be cast out from the village"
