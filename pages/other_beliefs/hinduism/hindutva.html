    The Relationship Between Radical Hindus and Inceldom

    Sexual frustration is a large part of what drives the radical hindu politics in India.

    Built upon an incel mentality that the strong alpha male Muslim Chads will take over.

    The radical hindu is extremely sexually insecure, due to what they perceive in the Muslim man; like those "virgin vs Chad" comics.

    There is a huge belief among their intellectuals that the alpha more-fertile Muslim man will "steal their" hindu women.

    (Anand, 2016, pg 51-52)

    <img src="../../../images/random3/hi44.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    There is constant fear and paranoia about the Chad Muslim alpha male. There is a stereotype that Muslim men are more handsome, and thus Hindu women will choose a Muslim man and stay away from hindu boys.

    (Anand, 2016, pg 63-64)

    <img src="../../../images/random3/hi46.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    The sexual insecurity is so extreme among radical hindus, that anytime a hindu girl falls in love with a Muslim alpha male, and converts, they believe she is "being kidnapped" and try to "rescue" her, and there is a big conspiracy by these Muslim Chads.

    (Anand, 2016, pg 65-66)

    <img src="../../../images/random3/hi48.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Ironically being an incel is seem as a virtue among hindu radicals, radical hindus often share stories of rape to entertain each other and as a form of "fun".

    Radical hindu men also have detailed sexual fantasies about the Chad Muslim men.

    (Anand, 2016, pg 75-76)

    <img src="../../../images/random3/hi4a.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    The average radical hindu male is not very successful in life, having no jobs, money or ambition to move higher in life.

    Thus sharing these stories of their sexual fantasies help them cope and makes them feel successful, as well as give them pleasure.

    (Anand, 2016, pg 77-78)

    <img src="../../../images/random3/hi4c.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Radical hindus believe that "Muslim men are too sexy" due to eating beef and getting circumcised. And that this is what hindu girls prefer more.

    They believe that Muslims are more manly than them, & the only way to compensate is to commit violence/rape.

    Why Hindu Women love Muslim Men

    An interesting scientific paper from India, explaining why Hindu women cheat on their Hindu husbands so much

    Hindu women explained that hindu men are unattractive, bad at sex, and are incels

    Many hindu women rather convert to Islam to be with a Muslim

    Radical Hindus and the hatred of Toilets


    Scientific papers find that this behavior is due to Hindu mythology which prohibit the use of toilets

    Radical hindus also do not use toilets, or let women use toilets, since toilets are an Islamic invention, & they believe it contributes to "love jihad"
