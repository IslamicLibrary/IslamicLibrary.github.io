    ASalam alikum
    Today we will prove the existence of god using since and some commonsense
    We aren't going to talk about contingency arrangement no so read carefully



    If I told U that I was walking on the Beach and found a huge box full of manuscripts each one contained millions of codes each code means something and when we take these codes in context we can find informations and instructions in it like instructions for building airplanes . with no single mistake in it but I don't now the sorce of these manuscripts but I have to hypothesis ok
    《 The first one is that these manuscripts that contain millions of codes are made by blind randomness no one made them all these informations that gives specific details about haw to build a complicated structures like airplanes with no mistakes in it are made by random reactions in the nature 》

    The second hypothesis is that informations requires intelligence but nature doesn't have intelligence it has 0 IQ levels everything happens in it is just random so we say an intelligent sorce made these manuscripts how knows haw to make manuscripts and to write on it ( coded informations )
    Not just informations no he even coded them so no one can understand them easily.
    The commonsense says the second one is the most logical hypothesis because informations requires intelligence and no one can give a situation when the randomness produced a specific coded informations



    Maybe you will say ok but what is the connection between that and the existence of god ?
    The answer is that there is similar situation in the reality with the same details
    It called the《 DNA 》
    If we saw the first  creature lived on this earth we will find that it's bacteria called 《 Cyanobacteria, also known as Cyanophyta 》this bacteria has about 500 genes and each gen has about 10,000 base pairs or nitrogen bases so totally it has about 5 million nitrogen base or 《codes》a similar situation to first example is it !

    So this evidence is irrefutable even the the most famous atheist in the modern world (Richard Dawkins) couldn't say that the DNA came by randomness especially with those chances and numbers and he admitted that informations required intelligence and not randomness and accepted the idea of the intelligent designer

    For more clarification U can ask any  questions U want and we will be in service .

    The Fine-Tuning of the universe, an undeniable fact

    For, the remarkable picture that is gradually emerging from modern physics and cosmology is one of a universe whose fundamental forces are amazingly, intricately, and delicately balanced or ‘fine-tuned’ in order for the universe to be able to sustain life. Recent research has shown that many of the fundamental constants of nature, from the energy levels in the carbon atom to the rate at which the universe is expanding, have just the right values for life to exist. Change any of them just a little, and the universe would become hostile to life and incapable of supporting it. The constants are precision-tuned, and it is this fine-tuning that many scientists (and others) think demands an explanation.
    The fine-tuning of the nuclear ground state energy with respect to each other

    For life to exist on earth an abundant supply of carbon is needed.
    Carbon is formed either by combining three helium nuclei, or by combining
    nuclei of helium and beryllium. Eminent mathematician and astronomer, Sir
    Fred Hoyle, found that for this to happen, the nuclear ground state energy
    levels have to be fine-tuned with respect to each other. This phenomenon is
    called ‘resonance’. If the variation were more than 1 per cent either way, the
    universe could not sustain life. Hoyle later confessed that nothing had
    shaken his atheism as much as this discovery. Even this degree of finetuning was enough to persuade him that it looked as if ‘a superintellect has
    monkeyed with physics as well as with chemistry and biology’, and that
    ‘there are no blind forces in nature worth talking about’[1].

    The fine-tuning in the ratio of the nuclear strong force to the electromagnetic force

    Theoretical physicist Paul Davies tells us that, if
    the ratio of the nuclear strong force to the electromagnetic force had been
    different by 1 part in 10^16 , no stars could have formed. Again, the ratio of
    the electromagnetic force-constant to the gravitational force-constant must
    be equally delicately balanced. Increase it by only 1 part in 10^40 and only
    small stars can exist; decrease it by the same amount and there will only be
    large stars. You must have both large and small stars in the universe: the
    large ones produce elements in their thermonuclear furnaces; and it is only
    the small ones that burn long enough to sustain a planet with life.
    To use Davies’ illustration:

    That is the kind of accuracy a marksman
    would need to hit a coin at the far side of the observable universe, twenty billion light years away !. [1]

    If we find that difficult to imagine, a further
    illustration suggested by astrophysicist Hugh Ross may help. [2]

    Cover America with coins in a column reaching to the moon (380,000 km or
    236,000 miles away), then do the same for a billion other continents of the
    same size. Paint one coin red and put it somewhere in one of the billion
    piles. Blindfold a friend and ask her to pick it out. The odds are about 1 in
    10^40 that she will.

    Entropy is increasing, mind boggling...

    Yet even these examples of precision-tuning are completely eclipsed by
    what is perhaps the most mind-boggling example of all.

    Our universe is a universe in which entropy (a measure of disorder) is increasing.
    A fact which is enshrined in the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Eminent
    mathematician Sir Roger Penrose writes:

    ‘Try to imagine the phase space… of the entire universe. Each point in this phase space represents a different
    possible way that the universe might have started off. We are to picture the
    Creator, armed with a ‘pin’ – which is to be placed at some point in the
    phase space… Each different positioning of the pin provides a different
    universe. Now the accuracy that is needed for the Creator’s aim depends on
    the entropy of the universe that is thereby created. It would be relatively
    ‘easy’ to produce a high entropy universe, since then there would be a large
    volume of the phase space available for the pin to hit. But in order to start
    off the universe in a state of low entropy – so that there will indeed be a
    second law of thermodynamics – the Creator must aim for a much tinier
    volume of the phase space. How tiny would this region be, in order that a
    universe closely resembling the one in which we actually live would be the
    result?’

    His calculations lead him to the remarkable conclusion that the
    ‘Creator’s aim’ must have been accurate to 1 part in 10 to the power 10^123,
    that is 1 followed by 10^123 zeros. A ‘number which it would be impossible
    to write out in the usual decimal way, because even if you were able to put a
    zero on every particle in the universe there would not even be enough particles to do the job’.[1]

    Faced with not one, but many such spectacular examples of fine-tuning,
    it is perhaps not surprising that Paul Davies says,

    ‘The impression of design
    is overwhelming.’[2]

    Haw could live started by 5 million codes each code means something and in context it gives information and instructions about haw to build a perfect cell with all the organelles it needs and the process it has it has to go through in order to get a single essential product like Photosynthesis a long complicated process
    Do you know the chances of having a similar sequence of 5M codes ?
    it's ((1÷4⁵⁰⁰⁰'⁰⁰⁰= a striking 0 ))

    Wich means even if you had infinite time and matter you still won't be able to produce the simplest form of life we discovered cyanobacteria
    But that's not the only problem .
    We said you have to do all that just to have similar sequence but what about making them in the first place in limited time and matter!!
    you maybe say I have a simple answer for that the live didn't start by that number it just started by one gen and evolved by time to reach 500 genes .
    God hypothesis but there is one problem
    Sintficly it's impossible to have a live with number of gens less than 480 gens we call this law 《Minimal gen set concept》
    So you have to start by 4.8M codes at least to give such example
