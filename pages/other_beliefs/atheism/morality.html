    If I were to asked you if something was moral or immoral, based upon what did you label it as moral or immoral? If I asked “is rape objectively wrong?” And you replied with “yes.” Why did you reply this yes? Based upon what? Based upon either 3 things and I shall attempt to dismantle those views.

    1. Due to your subjective opinion, your subjective opinion is literally just your preference and it isn’t objective at all, for example if I asked you “does chocolate or vanilla taste better?” And due to vanilla being more satisfactory for you, you replied with vanilla does this mean objectively vanilla tastes better than chocolate? No of course not, it’s literally your opinion which is contingent on your taste buds. So subjectivity isn’t a valid form of reasoning to differentiate between right and wrong 100% of the time.

    2. Because the majority of people think it, well 4000yrs ago the majority of people believed the earth was flat, does this mean objectively the earth was flat? No of course not, so as I have just demonstrated the majority of people’s views on something isn’t always factual, it can’t be used 100% of the time to differentiate between good and bad.

    3. Whenever something negative is done such as rape, our minds, our emotions inform us it is wrong, the issue with this is your emotions are also subjective, for example a group of bullies won’t view bullying a kid as immoral, for them maximising their enjoyment is more essential than the feelings of the boy, but the boy however might feel enraged and deeply upset,

    to present another example imagine if you killed someone and you viewed it as wrong because of your emotions, a psychopath doesn’t view it as wrong do they? A psychopath’s emotions doesn’t always tell them that a certain thing such as murder is bad, so for psychopaths does this standard of identifying right and wrong not apply to them? So how could they differentiate between right and wrong?
    The only way for us to possess morality, the only for us to differentiate between right and wrong, is to depend upon an objective source [THE QURAN], the only other remaining suitable option would be, a maximally great and morally perfect necessary being, who we can derive moral laws from. [Allah]

    Can Atheists really criticise Sexual immorality?
