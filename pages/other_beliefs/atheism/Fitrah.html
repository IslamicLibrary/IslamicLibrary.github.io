    Asadullah Ali’s Philosophical Argument for Fitrah

    This is also a response to atheists who say that belief in God is like belief in Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, Flying Spaghetti Monster, etc

    Premise 1: If meaning and explanation can only come from the natural world, then all conceptions of reality come from the natural world

    Premise 2: If all conceptions of reality are derived from the natural world, then there must be a coherence of meaningful experiences

    Premise 3: People believe that there is a transcendent reality (i.e God) that shares no properties with the natural world

    Premise 4: If Premise 1, and Premise 2 are true, then Premise 3 should be a conception derived from the natural world, which content is a coherence of meaningful experiences

    Premise 5: No number of meaningful experiences can direct one to consider the possibility of something meaningful beyond said experiences

    Conclusion: Therefore Premise 3 is not a conception of reality derived from the natural world

    Children are born to believe in a creator

    Psychologists say that infants have a natural belief in a creator

    Psychologist says that religion is natural in children

     "when children are directly asked about the origin of animals and people, they tend to prefer explanations that involve an intentional creator, even if the adults who raised them do not."
    — Paul Bloom

    Religion is natural, Department of Psychology, Yale University.

    Atheists have a fitrah as well

    "After being primed by thoughts of death, religious participants were faster to press a button to affirm God’s existence, but non-religious participants were slower to press a button denying God’s existence."

    This again proves that even the unaffiliated people have a belief in God regardless if they dont follow a religious doctrine
