    Salam alikum.
    One of the greatest icons of evolution in archaeology field is called Australopithecus afarensis

    Orã€ŠLucyã€‹


    it is a collection of several hundred pieces of fossilized bone representing 40 percent of a female of the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis. In Ethiopia, the assembly is also known as Dinkinesh,

    But is she really human ancestors?

    after recent studies published by many famous magazines like PNAS it became obvious that Lucy is just bedtime story

    The study says that this specie is just another extinct specie of gorillas
    They found that the
    Mandibular ramus morphology on a recently discovered specimen of Australopithecus afarensis closely matches that of gorillas
    And different from the one of the humans and the supposed relatives chimpanzees

    The second fossil we have is the ã€Š Homo habilis  ã€‹
    many people would think that this fossils is complete fossils with all the details we need to classify it ass human ancestor but that's only in on the social media but in reality it is just apart of foot and upper half of skull scientists to this moment still arguing on the origin of this fossil unlike the the propagation we here every there
    And these disagreements are opened to public at biggest scientific magazines in world ã€Šnatureã€‹but people loves to listen to Science Fiction rather than search for the real science
    Let's see what scientists think about this fossil .

    The third one is called Ardipithecus ramidus, thought to be an early human-like female anthropoid 4.4 million years old
    But does scientists agrees on this fossil or it's just like it's sisters?

    Today we are talking about the most famous human ancestor on evolution tree of the human being it's the neanderthal

    Lived: from about 400,000 to 40,000 years ago

    â€¢ Brain size: at least 1,200cm3 to 1,750cm3

    â€¢ Height: about 1.50-1.75m

    â€¢ Weight: about 64-82kg

    â€¢ Diet: meat, plants and fungi, shellfish when available

    â€¢ Where: across Europe and southwest and central Asia
    Neanderthals were humans like us, but they were a distinct species called Homo neanderthalensis

    the scientist was thinking that extinction was because the mental inferiority of the Neanderthals compared to the humans and they assumed that they are just a human ancestor but that's not true because those assumption is built upon uncomplicated data

    The reason that I'm saying that Neanderthals are humans is that the recent studies prove that there is no mental inferiority in the case of Neanderthals compared to the human beings because these recent studies proves that Neanderthals were able to make their own tools without the help of any modern humans by the time and they were very good in both fishing and hunting  and they was also very good in using the fire in there favour not just that they also were able to do Trading and they also were able to speak because the studies proved by using Advanced CT scan that they have a similar vocal cords just like the humans and they also have the same gene responsible for speaking in the humans which is identical which is ã€ŠFOXP2ã€‹ which is by the way different in chimpanzees that's why they can't speak but in the case of Neanderthals the majority of data refers that they are able to speak and the very significant discovery that I am impressed by was the main reason for considering the Neanderthals humans is that they had a spiritual experiences and they had religions too and the evidence for that is that some studies proved that there is some fossils for them  bearing their dead or burning them with very specific ways with spiritual details

    The third one ðŸ‘†
    And finally the biggest paper about the Neanderthals wich discussed 151 different studies about the Neanderthals
    And proved that the reason for disappearing of the Neanderthals is not because they couldn't compete the modern humans because of there inferiority
    But instead the only reason is that Neanderthals merge together and were able to have families together and there DNA is still in the the modern humans with similarity about 99.9%
