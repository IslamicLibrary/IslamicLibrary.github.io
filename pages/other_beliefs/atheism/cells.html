    Aslam alikum .
    Today we have very sensitive topic to talk about
    《 The free will and the consciousness  》

    From atheistic point view the human beings are nothing except a chemical waste so there is no meaning for live every thing You feel is just some chemical reactions inside your brain and from this perspective there is no value for good or evil every thing is the same even your designs is just delusion because your  consciousness resulted from the brain wich is
    And the brain is nothing more than couple neuron cells exchanging (Na - K - Ca+²)
    On it's walls to give the charge you need to produce consciousness
    But is that sintficly True !!
    If the brain is the source of consciousness
    Then any damage happened to the brain means losing the consciousness and all Signs of intelligence like memory feeling and responding to any stimulation
    But sintficly that's not true for example
    The sintest karl lashley had an experiment on rats with surgically induced brain lesions, by damaging or removing specific areas of a rat’s cortex, either before or after the animals were trained in mazes and the rats still remembered what they have learned even after losing parts of the brain the memory didn't lost

    <a href="https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/karl-lashley#:~:text=Lashley%20pioneered%20experimental%20work%20conducted,in%20mazes%20and%20visual%20discrimination">https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/karl-lashley#:~:text=Lashley%20pioneered%20experimental%20work%20conducted,in%20mazes%20and%20visual%20discrimination</a>.

    Also if the brain were the source of consciousness then when we split the human brain to two separate part 《hemispheres》 by cutting the
    《corpus callosum》wich connects the two hemispheres to each others we should have two separated consciousness because we have two separated brains giving to separate consciousness
    But the Nobel Prize winner called
    Roger Sperry has something else to say
    In the 1950s and 1960s, Roger Sperry performed experiments on cats, monkeys, and humans to study functional differences between the two hemispheres of the brain
    He was doing surgeries to epilepsy patients by cutting there corpus callosum between the hemispheres in order to reduce the communication between them and reduce the severity of seizures
    But Roger Sperry didn't find changes related to consciousness like having two contradicting feelings or desires in his patients the only changes he has was about fiscal abilities like speaking echoes etc

    <a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/roger-sperrys-split-brain-experiments-1959-1968">https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/roger-sperrys-split-brain-experiments-1959-1968</a>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4yRroomGxl8">https://youtu.be/4yRroomGxl8</a>

    And finally if someone lost most of his brain would he still be conscious ?
    This stat called 《vegetative state》this refers to a patient's who don't have any fiscal respond 《in coma》
    《BUT》
    adrian Owen  a neuro_scientist who made a sintafic experiment with practical method destroyed the I idea of brain as source of consciousness by communicating with patients in vegetative state with was impossible from materialistic point view
    Adrian owen communicated with people in coma = vegetative state by a device called
    《fMRI》
    and the people who was in coma responded to adrian's question (yes or no) questions without using the parts of the brain it's needed to such a process and patients answered 5/6 questions correctly
    Wich can't be just a Coincidence
    So we just demonstrated that consciousness is not a product from the brain but they are totally two different things working together to complete the majestically cycle
