    The notion of God being evil is very fallacious because it assumes that the atheist‚Äôs standards for morality are above God. Furthermore God has far more knowledge than any human being and thus has a reason for allowing anything to happen even if we humans don‚Äôt have the full picture.

    But here‚Äôs the major flaw in the atheist argument üëá

    Atheists make a big fuss about the ‚Äúproblem of evil‚Äù and how they cannot in good conscience accept that God exists in the face of a world full of innocent people suffering. Curiously, they are not equally perturbed by the prospect of innocent people suffering tremendously at the hands of the wicked who themselves live comfortable lives and will never have to face any consequence or repercussion for their crimes.
    And when you think about it, which scenario is more troubling? In the world of the theist, innocent people who suffered due to disease and poverty will ultimately be recompensed for the pain they endured. But in the world of the atheist, evil is never requited.
    How ironic, then, for atheists to accuse the God they don‚Äôt believe in of being unjust when they are otherwise perfectly content with the idea of a world without ultimate justice.
