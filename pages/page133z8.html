    As such, satire has its limits even as an exception and should not be indulged in without justification and moderation.

    In another incident, one of the senior companions used a particularly harsh phrase against an idolater in the
    midst of a confrontation.

    During the war with the Meccans, the Muslims were mostly on the defensive and, as was Arab custom, they wanted
    to utilize the sanctity of Mecca to perform the lesser pilgrimage. This culminated in the treaty of Hudaybiyyah,
    which was a ten-year peace treaty between the Muslims and the idolaters.

    In this tense negotiation, ‘Urwah ibn Mas’ud (who later became a Muslim) mocked the Muslims by claiming they were
    undignified and would abandon the Prophet (s) if exposed to danger. Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, was understandably
    upset by this and he responded with a well-known Arabic expression:

    امْصُصْ بَظْرَ اللاَّتِ أَنَحْنُ نَفِرُّ عَنْهُ وَنَدَعُهُ

    Suck the genitals of al-Lat! Would we flee from him and leave?

    Source: Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 2583, Grade: Sahih
    Ibn Hajar comments on this incident, saying:

    وَكَانَتْ عَادَةُ الْعَرَبِ الشَّتْمُ بِذَلِكَ لَكِنْ بِلَفْظِ الْأُمِّ فَأَرَادَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ الْمُبَالَغَةَ فِي سَبِّ عُرْوَةَ بِإِقَامَةِ مَنْ كَانَ يَعْبُدُ مَقَامَ أُمِّهِ وَحَمَلَهُ عَلَى ذَلِكَ مَا أَغْضَبَهُ بِهِ مِنْ نِسْبَةِ الْمُسْلِمِينَ إِلَى الْفِرَارِ

    It was the customs of Arabs to revile each other that way, but by using the word ‘mother’ instead. Abu Bakr
    intended to use exaggerated rhetoric in his condemnation of ‘Urwah, so he put the idol he worshiped in place of his mother.
    He was compelled to do that because he was angered by the cowardice that had been attributed to the Muslims.

    Source: Fatḥ al-Bārī 2583

    In this specific situation, Abu Bakr was so angered and the circumstances so high-stress that he responded with a
    harsh phrase that was common in Arab poetry. It was not considered especially vulgar, although it loses something in the translation.
    The Prophet (s) did not command him to say it, but he did not publicly rebuke him either.

    At most, it was permissible for Abu Bakr to use this phrase or at least his frustration was understandable enough
    not to be publicly criticized for it. ‘Urwah was upset too, of course, but that did not stop him from accepting Islam later.

    On other occasions, the Prophet (s) publicly rebuked Abu Bakr for using insulting language as the general rule
    prohibits using such words.

    Abu Huraira reported: A man reviled Abu Bakr while the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was sitting.
    Then Abu Bakr reviled the man with the same words and the Prophet became angry and he stood to leave. Abu Bakr went
    to the Prophet and he said, “O Messenger of Allah, the man reviled me and you were sitting, but when I responded you
    became angry and stood up.” The Prophet said:

    إِنَّهُ كَانَ مَعَكَ مَلَكٌ يَرُدُّ عَنْكَ فَلَمَّا رَدَدْتَ عَلَيْهِ بَعْضَ قَوْلِه وقع الشيطان فلم أكن لأقعد مع الشيطان

    Verily, there was an angel with you responding on your behalf, but Satan appeared when you responded with the
    same words as him and I will not sit in the presence of Satan.

    Source: Musnad Ahmad 9411, Grade: Jayyid
    Aisha reported: Abu Bakr once cursed some of his slaves, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said:

    يَا أَبَا بَكْرٍ اللَّعَّانِينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ‏؟‏ كَلاَّ وَرَبِّ الْكَعْبَةِ

    O Abu Bakr! Those who curse or those who are true? No, by the Lord of the Ka’bah!

    On that day, Abu Bakr freed some of his slaves. Then the Prophet came to him and he said:

    لا أَعُودُ

    Do not do it again.

    Source: al-Adab al-Mufrad 319, Grade: Sahih

    When examining the totality of Abu Bakr’s biography, conduct, and character, we can see that he would learn from
    his mistakes as the Prophet (s) corrected him and those lessons in humility resulted in his honorable and distinguished
    service as the first Caliph of Islam.

    In another report attributed to the Prophet (s), Muslims were told to respond to tribal sloganeering with another
    well-known Arabic rebuke:

    مَنْ تَعَزَّى بِعَزَاءِ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ فَأَعِضُّوهُ وَلَا تَكْنُوا

    Whoever glorifies himself with the glory of ignorance, then tell him to bite it and do not use a metaphor.

    Source: Musnad Aḥmad 20729
    Questions of authenticity aside, this narration refers to tribal lineage aggrandizing as was done during the period of
    pre-Islamic ignorance and which was the cause of so much bloodshed. The phrase “bite it” implies his father’s private part,
    which was a common way of humiliating a tribalist by reminding him of his unimpressive origin, the fallacy of claiming privilege through lineage.

    Tribalism at the time was a type of racism, bigotry, and xenophobia, with often violent implications, and therefore
    it should be rightly shunned by the Muslim society. Muslims used this specific harsh phrase to place a social taboo on tribalism.

    Ibn al-Qayyim comments on these traditions, saying:

    دَلِيلٌ عَلَى جَوَازِ التَّصْرِيحِ بِاسْمِ الْعَوْرَةِ إِذَا كَانَ فِيهِ مَصْلَحَةٌ … فَلِكُلِّ مَقَامٍ مَقَالٌ

    It is evidence for the permission of explicitly naming the private part if it is in the best interest… for every
    situation has an appropriate speech.

    Source: Zād al-Ma’ād 3/267

    Indeed, situations might call for different reactions for a variety reasons. Gentleness in the face of abject tyranny
    is weakness, but harshness in the face of ordinary disagreements is oppressive. It requires the wisdom of scholarship and
    life-experience to recognize the exceptional circumstances when harsh words are justified. We cannot generalize the permission
    of harshness when the overwhelming majority of texts counsel otherwise.

    In most everyday situations, Muslims should be kind, gentle, and measured in the way they talk to others.
    This is even more critical in the age of social media, when text-based communication lacks the context of tone, inflection,
    and other non-verbal cues. Miscommunication using this medium is an ever present danger that can be easily reduced by toning it down.

    At the same time, lay Muslims should look to the example of recognized senior Imams and scholars for
    guidance on when harshness is appropriate. Our elders have the wisdom of experience and we should follow their lead. If one
    is unsure that harshness is called for, then it is better and safer to stay silent.
    Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:

    رَحِمَ اللَّهُ امْرَأً تَكَلَّمَ فَغَنِمَ أَوْ سَكَتَ فَسَلِمَ

    May Allah have mercy on a person who spoke rightly and was rewarded, or who was silent and remained safe.

    Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows best.
