    shows a closer look at the Earth's crust and upper mantle. It shows that the mountains thrust the mantle
    downward and they have roots beneath. To have the mountains in isostatic equilibrium they need to have roots
    inside the upper mantle. This is one of the assumptions of Airy (1855); such roots represent masses,
    which are known as compensation masses. The geometry and density of such masses play the main role in an
    isostatic equilibrium. Different geometries and densities of the compensation masses can keep the crust in
    equilibrium

    Abstract
    We investigate the effects of large-scale surface topography on ground motions generated by nearby faulting.
    We show a specific example studying the effect of the San Gabriel Mountains, which are bounded by the Mojave
    segment of the San Andreas fault on the north and by the Los Angeles Basin on the south. By simulating a Mw 7.5
    earthquake on the Mojave segment of the San Andreas fault, we show that the San Gabriel Mountains act as a natural
    seismic insulator for metropolitan Los Angeles. The topography of the mountains scatters the surface waves generated
    by the rupture on the San Andreas fault, leading to less-efficient excitation of basin-edge generated waves and
    natural resonances within the Los Angeles Basin. The effect of the mountains reduces the peak amplitude of ground
    velocity for some regions in the basin by as much as 50% in the frequency band up to 0.5 Hz. These results suggest
    that, depending on the relative location of faulting and the nearby large-scale topography,
    the topography can shield some areas from ground shaking.

    “Mountains have proven to be slightly helpful when it comes to preventing earthquakes. Mountains have the ability
    to direct the earthquakes to another region where they tend to become more powerful than their original magnitude.”

    “According to the research of Professor Mark van der Meijde, mountains influence the impact of earthquakes.
    It was already known that the topography of an area has an influence on earthquakes, but the major influence
    at the local level is new. Mountains can reduce the power of quakes, but also direct them to certain places,
    making them more powerful than expected.”

    “The research started after the earthquake in Kathmandu (Nepal) in 2015. More than 100,000 people were expected
    to die, but in the end around 1,700 people in Kathmandu and 11,000 throughout Nepal died as a result of the
    earthquake. A lot of research was done, but so far, researchers had not determined why there were so few victims.”
    Keep in mind that Nepal is considered one of the top countries with many mountains…

    Aslam alikum
    Today we will answer a claim about surah An-Nahl
    In verse 15 when allah says
    《 وألقى في الارض رواسي أن تميد بكم 》

    The first claim is that why did allah said (ألقى)
    Isn't that mean he Throw those rawasy wich is mountains ?
    Because this is sintafic mistake that is not haw mountain are formed .
    The answer is very simple and I will bring the tafsire of both ( altabary ) and ( Fakhruddin Al-Razi )
    Both saide that the word (ألقى) doesn't mean Throw but instead it means (جعل) wich is made or created
    and not throw
    These two squalors understood the meaning of this verses before the field of Geology's existence

    <img src="../images/random2/13283.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    The second part of the claims is that Quran makes the claim that the mountains are stabilizing the Earth
    crust which is scientifically wrong mountains does not stabilize Earth there is no scientific evidence for
    that so this is a scientific error in the Quran


    The answer.
    In Geology field it's not that simple to prove or disprove any theory because it's based upon speculations
    supported by some mathematical explanations yes we have the equipment we need to see the geological structure
    of the Earth's crust but we still have problems with understanding the mechanisms of some  Natural phenomenas
    like earthquake and what's happening during it

    <img src="../images/random2/13284.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    But even so there is scientific theories that support what the Quran


    For example we know that the Earth crust has the structures that we call mountains and mountains are
    distributed in the Earth's crust and we know that there is the mountains that we can see which is above
    the surface of the water and there is another types of mountains that exists under water surface we call
    them Seamountain the the interesting thing is that there is some theory made by some geologists saying that
    this sea mountains act as a Heroes because they are helping in
    Halting a subduction earthquake in it's track

    So they are associating in the stabilization of the outer crust the we live on or it will case a tsunami
    that will destroy everything

    <a href="https://www.livescience.com/18548-diving-mountains-stop-start-earthquakes-subduction-seamounts.html">https://www.livescience.com/18548-diving-mountains-stop-start-earthquakes-subduction-seamounts.html</a>

    And the other hand there is another theory it's called The isostasy Theory this city says that during an a
    collision of the internal Earth crusts that will cause a Instability the Earth's tectonic layers so what happens
    is that the eyes of Stacey mechanism causing a formation of two parts the first part is the pics of the mountains
    that we can absorb and see which we call them the mountains and the second part which is the mountain roots which
    is the part that we cannot see and this part is a structure that goes deep to the internal layers of the Earth and
    stabilizing these layers to certain level

    Scientists also says that when the earthquakes are done and finished the eyes of Stacy mechanisms will make
    these mountains disappear because the purpose of this Mountains from the first point is stabilizing the
    equilibrium stability of this Liars and so the mountains will slowly disappear and it goes to the original
    structure which is a straight line so we can conclude that yes the mountains do stabilize the Earth because
    during earthquakes that are Stacy mechanism have to form this mountains in order to stabilize these lies and
    after the earthquake is done we see that the purpose of this mountains are already done so we don't need this
    mountains anymore so that's why this mountains are disappearing the only reason that this mountain does not
    disappear that fast is because the making of us Stacey makes it slower than it normally should.

    Do Mountains Stop Earthquakes?

    Mountains are considered to be the nail that holds the Earth together. This process is known as Isostasy.
    This is the process of stabilizing the Earth using the stress of gravity from the mountains.
    They play a major role in keeping the Earth in balance.
