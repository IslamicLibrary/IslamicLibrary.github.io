    Q: is the drinker of wine killed like in hadith

    All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, is His Slave and Messenger.

    A Muslim should know that it is not necessary that the Shree‘ah ruling, whether a prescribed corporal punishment or whatsoever, is established by the Quran or a Hadeeth Qudsi only. The Sharee‘ah ruling is also established by the Prophetic Hadeeth, which is a Revelation from Allaah The Almighty and conclusive evidence like the Quran. Allaah The Almighty Says (what means): {Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination. It is not but a revelation revealed.}[Quran 53:3-4]
    However, we previously mentioned a collection of proofs of the authoritativeness of the Sunnah and that it is an adducible source of Sharee‘ah. For further details, refer to Fatwa 81124.
    Moreover, it is correct that the ruling of killing the consumer of alcohol was abrogated. Ash-Shaafi‘i  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  him said, "There is no difference concerning this among any of the scholars that I know of.”
    Allaah Knows best.
