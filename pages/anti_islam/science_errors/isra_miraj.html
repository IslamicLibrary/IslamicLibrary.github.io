    Many people tend to make fun of the idea that the prophet went from the mosque in mecca to Jerusalem at night
    Although this is a miracle that means it shouldn’t be explained by scientifical laws for atheists reading this
    to break the laws is impossible to you but if God exists which he does he can let it happen that is the theist
    view you can’t disprove the miracle.

    But what kind of proof did prophet muhammed bring back to his people to believe him
    Translation: “Abu bakr said I testify that you are Gods messenger the pagans then made fun of them the prophet
    then gave them detail about the caravan that would be coming in a few days after a few days the tribe with exact
    detail has shown up”.

    translation: “It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that theMessenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:I found myself in
    Hijr and the Quraish were asking me about my might journey. I was asked about things pertaining to Bait-ul-Maqdis
    which I could not preserve (in my mind). I was very much vexed, so vexed as I had never been before.
    Then Allah raised it (Bait-ul-Maqdis) before my eyes. I looked towards it, and I gave them the information about
    whatever they questioned me I also saw myself among the group of apostles.”

    Anyone who didn’t go there couldn’t get this information
    Now some people claim it was in the dream however if that was the case God wouldn’t call it one of his greatest
    miracles/signs since I can do same in a dream

    Surah An-Najm (The Star)
    53:18
    He certainly saw some of his Lord’s greatest signs.
    Translation: Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran | Meccan

    Another claim is it having wings however this isn’t the case since once in a narration Aisha told the prophet
    that the horses of Solomon had wings and he laughed meaning he knew it doesn’t make sense ,
    there is no evidence it had wings
    Now a last claim is that it was copied from the Zoroastrians however this isn’t plausible since the iranian
    encyclopedia says they copied it from Islamic literature

    A response to refute all of this is what Abu bakr said when the pagans were making fun of the prophet, he said
    “I believe he was sent by the lord above the 7 earthes that he gets information from there so I won’t believe that?”

    Incase a Christian makes that claim… 👇

    And to prove the description is talking about prophet Muhammed pbuh: -
    - white horse

    - Prophet Muhammad Pbuh truthfulnesses and trustworthiness

    “They said, "Put among you a judge." They said, "The first man to come out of the crude, and the Prophet

    - Prophet Muhammed pbuh justice
    In this narration a hypocrite came and told the prophet “do justice”

    <img src="../../../images/random2/1321c.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    And we can find many other narrations where he pbuh orders others to do justice and verses
    where Allah swt orders justice

    Surah Al-Haaqqa (The Reality)
    69:44
    if [the Prophet] had attributed some fabrication to Us,
    69:45
    We would certainly have seized his right hand
    69:46
    and cut off his lifeblood,
    69:47
    and none of you could have defended him.
    69:48
    This [Quran] is a reminder for those who are aware of God.
    Translation: Abdul Haleem | Meccan

    Surah Al-Israa (The Night Journey)
    17:1
    Glory to Him who made His servant travel by night from the sacred place of worship
    to the furthest place of worship, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him some of Our signs:
    He alone is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.
    Translation: Abdul Haleem | Meccan

    <h1>Addressing Claims Against Isra’ and Miraj 👇</h1>
    <h2>Claim 1</h2>
    “The report in Syar a’alam al-nubala’ al-sirah al-nabawiyah volume 1 page number 198 is unreliable as the prophet gave vague, nonspecific details about an oncoming caravan, and any caravan having those features could have shown up! It’s not impressive.”
    If one actually decided to pay more than a simple cursory glance at the report, they would immediately realise their mired parochialism - in no way are those details “vague” and “non specific”
    Ataraxia — heute um 16:48 Uhr
    To paraphrase, it is basic common sense that the more conditions added cumulatively onto the previous ones, the more restricted and particular your statement becomes.

    Let us illustrate an example:

    Consider the statement  “it will rain”

    Now of course, that’s very vague and non-particular. If i said, “it will rain today”, that restricts the statement much more.

    If I then say “it will rain today at 3pm” - that further particularises it.

    If I go on to say “it will rain today at 3 pm in New York” - once again, further accentuating the specificity and imposing more restrictions on our original statement.
    Now, according to pervasive anti Islamic polemic, the statement of the Prophet that a very particular type of caravan will come is ‘vague’. Reading the report with more than just a jittering, frazzled peek:

    <img src="../../../images/random2/1321e.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    “..I passed upon a caravan coming for you, in this place, and they lost their camels, and then so and so recollected them, and their march is coming this way, and then they’ll change to that way, and they’ll come to you on this particular day and time, led by a white camel, on it is a black saddle, and two black sacks…”

    This in no way is ‘vague’. There are many intricacies of this report that illuminate the stark impossibility of mere ‘guessing’.

    But I no need elucidate further - I want you to go and ponder over how likely it is for one to say oh this organised caravan will lose their camels, and this man of a particular rank in the caravan would retrieve them.

    Beyond this, I want you to look up the rarity of white camels, their value, and the plausibility of them partaking in vigorous trade labour, especially at the front of a caravan.

    <h2>Claim 2</h2>
    “If Jibreel’s wings are said to cover the entire horizon, how then did the prophet see a green carpet over the horizon? Plus green skies like that are not uncommon during tornados and storms in Arabia.”
