    Many people tend to make fun of the idea that the prophet went from the mosque in mecca to Jerusalem at night
    Although this is a miracle that means it shouldn’t be explained by scientifical laws for atheists reading this
    to break the laws is impossible to you but if God exists which he does he can let it happen that is the theist
    view you can’t disprove the miracle.

    But what kind of proof did prophet muhammed bring back to his people to believe him
    Translation: “Abu bakr said I testify that you are Gods messenger the pagans then made fun of them the prophet
    then gave them detail about the caravan that would be coming in a few days after a few days the tribe with exact
    detail has shown up”.

    translation: “It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that theMessenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:I found myself in
    Hijr and the Quraish were asking me about my might journey. I was asked about things pertaining to Bait-ul-Maqdis
    which I could not preserve (in my mind). I was very much vexed, so vexed as I had never been before.
    Then Allah raised it (Bait-ul-Maqdis) before my eyes. I looked towards it, and I gave them the information about
    whatever they questioned me I also saw myself among the group of apostles.”

    Anyone who didn’t go there couldn’t get this information
    Now some people claim it was in the dream however if that was the case God wouldn’t call it one of his greatest
    miracles/signs since I can do same in a dream

    Surah An-Najm (The Star)
    53:18
    He certainly saw some of his Lord’s greatest signs.
    Translation: Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran | Meccan

    Another claim is it having wings however this isn’t the case since once in a narration Aisha told the prophet
    that the horses of Solomon had wings and he laughed meaning he knew it doesn’t make sense ,
    there is no evidence it had wings
    Now a last claim is that it was copied from the Zoroastrians however this isn’t plausible since the iranian
    encyclopedia says they copied it from Islamic literature

    A response to refute all of this is what Abu bakr said when the pagans were making fun of the prophet, he said
    “I believe he was sent by the lord above the 7 earthes that he gets information from there so I won’t believe that?”

    Incase a Christian makes that claim… 👇

    And to prove the description is talking about prophet Muhammed pbuh: -
    - white horse

    - Prophet Muhammad Pbuh truthfulnesses and trustworthiness

    <img src="../../../images/random2/13217.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    “They said, "Put among you a judge." They said, "The first man to come out of the crude, and the Prophet
    (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came and they said, "The honest came to you."
    Source: Musnad Ahmed ibn hanbal (book 24/ pg: 262)

    “Untill Allah (SWT) sent to us a Messenger from us, we know his lineage, and truthfulnesses”

    - Prophet Muhammed pbuh justice
    In this narration a hypocrite came and told the prophet “do justice”

    <img src="../../../images/random2/1321c.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    And we can find many other narrations where he pbuh orders others to do justice and verses
    where Allah swt orders justice

    Surah Al-Haaqqa (The Reality)
    69:44
    if [the Prophet] had attributed some fabrication to Us,
    69:45
    We would certainly have seized his right hand
    69:46
    and cut off his lifeblood,
    69:47
    and none of you could have defended him.
    69:48
    This [Quran] is a reminder for those who are aware of God.
    Translation: Abdul Haleem | Meccan

    Surah Al-Israa (The Night Journey)
    17:1
    Glory to Him who made His servant travel by night from the sacred place of worship
    to the furthest place of worship, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him some of Our signs:
    He alone is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.
    Translation: Abdul Haleem | Meccan
