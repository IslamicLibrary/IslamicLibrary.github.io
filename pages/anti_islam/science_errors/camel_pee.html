    Critics like to use this argument they also like to use the argument that the WHO said it isn’t healthy

    First prophet muhammed didn’t order them to do so

    Anas b. Malik reported that some people belonging (to the tribe) of 'Uraina came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at Medina,
    but they found its climate uncogenial. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them:
    If you so like, you may go to the camels of Sadaqa and drink their milk and urine. They did so and were all right.
    They then fell upon the shepherds and killed them and turned apostates from Islam and drove off the camels of the Prophet (ﷺ).
    This news reached Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and he sent (people) on their track and they were (brought) and handed over to him.
    He (the Holy Prophet) got their hands cut off, and their feet, and put out their eyes, and threw them on the stony ground until
    they died.

    -Source: Sahih Muslim 1671 a
    Grade: Sahih (authentic)

    Thé prophet here clearly says if u like so you may meaning by choice  And it is only for the ”Urainies tribe”
    they even became ok after Their isn’t much evidence to back up if they actually did.
    Now lets see what science says

    Camel urine has anti cancerous properties

    Our #results confirm the traditional uses of camel urine as an #antimicrobial #agent, and may #not have #side #effects
    for humans. In addition, heating and storage of camel urine did not alter the main fungicidal effects.》

    Conclusion
    Medicinal uses of some of these compounds, confirm the therapeutic effects of female camel urine in our previous
    clinical studies. To enhance the utility and convenience of the degraded compounds, each compound should be fractionated and
    monitored to know its bioactivity against the actual disease.

    So yea it does have some benefit that is why 53:3-4 is applied here

    Disgusting things eaten or used today

    Poop to mouth:

    Cofee from poop:

    <a href="http://www.most-expensive.coffee/">http://www.most-expensive.coffee/</a>

    Historically speaking

    This practice was actually used by Roman Empire and Chinese empire before it might sound disgusting but it is effective

    <a href="https://www.healthing.ca/wellness/wtf-how-urine-improved-hygiene-and-oral-health-in-ancient-rome/">https://www.healthing.ca/wellness/wtf-how-urine-improved-hygiene-and-oral-health-in-ancient-rome/</a>

    Another important factor They lived in the 7th century they had no hospitals or anything camel pee contained the essential
    today we would just take the essential and leave other but at their time it wouldn’t actually work
   Muhammed the best of Mankind

   As the last attempt they would use this argument

   Yes he is the best of mankind actually that why he did this , prophet muhammed if alive today wouldn’t tell them to do that
   but to go to the hospital

   This is difference of history

   He had no other choice and he didn’t live in a hotel but he lived in a middle of the desert in the 7th century

   Finally what WHO said

   Critics would usually go to who as source for saying camel urine is bad But actually they fail who didn’t say that The only
   reason the who said this is because there is because their was a virus that was very common in camels right there meaning
   just as a scare from getting the virus You can read it yourself here:

   <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)</a>

   Is camel pee a sunnah ?

   Definitely not the prophet himself never drank it

   Is it najis

   According to the shafi’is and hanafis yes it is

   [Rad al-Muhtar 1/365]

   <img src="../images/random2/13261.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

   Shaykh ‘Ūthman Al-Khamis said it is impermissible to drink it like water although it is permissible to use it cure people.
