      morning-and-the-impact-of-believing-in-that-on-the-healing-effect</a>

      Some people claim that since Muhammad peace be upon him was once bewitched and poisoned it disproves the Hadith
      of the 7 Ajwa dates

      This is wrong because the Ahadith regarding the 7 Ajwa dates just say that it will only protect you from magic
      and poison on the day that you eat them. Itâ€™s not a protection for life
      ðŸ‘‡

      Narrated Sad:
      I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, "Whoever takes seven 'Ajwa dates in the morning will not be effected by
      magic or poison on that day."

      Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 5779


      Narrated Sad:
      Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "He who eats seven 'Ajwa dates every morning, will not be affected by poison or magic
      on the day he eats them."

      Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 5445


      Narrated Saud:
      The Prophet (ï·º) said, "If somebody takes some `Ajwa dates every morning, he will not be affected by poison or
      magic on that day till night." (Another narrator said seven dates).

      Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 5768

      Some people argue that the idea of seven ajwa dates protecting you from poison is scientifically erroneous as
      the chemical properties of the dates donâ€™t do this, however this is a misunderstanding of the hadith.
      Surah fatiha for example is also narrated to help heal you when you are ill, however this is not to say it has chemical properties to cure illness.
      It is an act of Ibadah which, with the permission of Allah, can protect you. This is evident from the fact that it also mentions magic,
      and off course a food does not have properties to protect from magic
