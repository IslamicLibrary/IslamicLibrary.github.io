    Salam alikum today we are discussing very famous shubha I think we all know the verse in the Quran
    (alhaj verse 46
    《أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌۭ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَآ أَوْ ءَاذَانٌۭ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا ۖ فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعْمَى ٱلْأَبْصَـٰرُ وَلَـٰكِن تَعْمَى ٱلْقُلُوبُ ٱلَّتِى فِى ٱلصُّدُورِ》
    《Have they not travelled throughout the land so their hearts may reason, and their ears may listen? Indeed,
    it is not the eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts in the chests that grow blind》


    that says and the have hurts may reason with and usually most of atheist use it in there
    discussing or debates with muslims as scientific mistake stating that
    how could it be a device for thinking ?!!
    And if that so why don't we see people changing there hearts and they don't change at all
    this is a scientific mistake .

    and the problem is that most muslims can't reply on this accusation or claims because they don't
    have the sufficient knowledge in medicine .

    today we are going to discuss this claim by empirical evidences.




    Personality changes following heart transplantation have been reported for
    decades and include accounts of recipients acquiring the personality characteristics of
    their donor. Four categories of personality changes are discussed basing on the data provided
    in this paper published in 2022
    Including
    (1) changes in preferences,
    (2) alterations in emotions/temperament, (3) modifications of identity,
    (4) memories from the donor’s life.



    (1) Changes in preferences

    Food preference


    Changes in food preferences are reported by numerous individuals and include
    differences in both the types of food preferred as well as the amount of food eaten. For example,
    a 29-year-old woman who received the heart of a 19-year-old donor who was
    a vegetarian related: “I hate meat now. I can’t stand it. I was McDonald’s biggest money
    maker, and now meat makes me throw up. Actually, when I even smell it, my heart
    starts to race”
    Another example comes from a 47-year-old male recipient who experienced a
    change in his reaction to food following transplantation. The donor was a 14-year-old
    gymnast who often skipped meals and would sometimes purge. The recipient
    explained: “. . . there’s something about food. I don’t know what it is. I get hungry, but
    after I eat, I often feel nauseated and that it would help if I could throw up”
    A third example was offered by a 48-year-old female recipient who developed a
    sudden taste for green peppers and chicken nuggets after her transplant, foods she
    never liked previously.
    In fact, as soon as she was allowed to drive after surgery, the
    recipient drove to Kentucky Fried Chicken and ordered chicken nuggets. Later, when
    she met her donor’s family, she asked if he liked green peppers. The response was,
    “Are you kidding? He loved them. . . But what he really loved was chicken nuggets”
    The recipient later learned that when her donor was killed in a motorcycle
    accident, a container of chicken nuggets was removed from beneath his jacke


    (2) Musical preference


    A different change in preference involves an altered inclination for music. In a
    study by Bunzel and colleagues, a 45-year-old recipient who received the heart of a 17-year-old boy
    reported: “I love to put on earphones and play loud music, something I never did before
    Another example comes from an 18-year-old girl who received the heart of an
    18-year-old boy killed in a motor vehicle accident. She described, “I could never play before,
    but after my transplant, I began to love music. I felt it in my heart. My heart had to play”
    The donor was a musician who played the guitar.
    A third example comes from a 47-year-old white male foundry worker who
    received the heart of a 17-year-old African American male killed in a drive-by shooting.
    The recipient described, “I used to hate classical music, but now I love it. So I know it’s not
    my new heart, because a black guy from the hood wouldn’t be into that. Now it calms my heart.
    I play it all the time. I more than like it”
    The recipient’s wife elaborated: “. . . he’s driving me nuts with the classical music.
    He doesn’t know the name of one song and never, never listened to it before. Now, he sits for
    hours and listens to it. He even whistles classical music songs that he could never know”.
    The donor’s mother reported, “Our son was walking to violin class when he was hit. Nobody knows
    where the bullet came from, but it just hit him and he fell. He died right there on the street
    hugging his violin case. He loved music and his teachers said he had a real thing for it.
    He would listen to music and play along with it”



    (3) Sexual preference

    Several recipients describe changes in sexual preference after obtaining a new
    heart. A 25-year-old male who received the heart of a 24-year-old female lesbian artist
    reported: “Since my surgery, I’ve been hornier than ever and women just seem to look even more
    erotic and sensual. . . I’m different. I know I’m different. I make love like I know exactly
    how a woman’s body feels and responds - almost as if it is my body.
    I have the same body, but I still think I’ve got a woman’s way of thinking about sex now

    A 29-year-old lesbian woman who received the heart of a 19-year-old
    heterosexual (have normal tendency toward men ) woman described
    experiencing a change in her sexual preference

    following her transplant: “. . . I’m engaged to be married now. He’s a great guy and we
    love each other. The sex is terrific. The problem is, I’m gay. At least, I thought I was.
    After my transplant, I’m not . . . I don’t think anyway . . . I’m sort of semi- or confused
    gay. Women still seem attractive to me, but my boyfriend turns me on. Women don’t. I
    have absolutely no desire to be with a woman. I think I got a gender transplant”



    (4) Other preferences and aversions


    Changes in preference for art and colors, as well as certain aversions are
    described following heart transplantation also. For example, a 25-year-old male
    graduate student who received the heart of a 24-year-old female landscape artist
    developed an interest in art following transplantation surgery. The recipient’s girlfriend
    described: “. . . he loves to go to museums. He would never, absolutely never do that.
    Now he would go every week. Sometimes he stands for minutes and looks at a painting
    without talking. He loves landscapes and just stares. Sometimes I just leave him there
    and come back later”
