    The question is why the Prophet did not apply the ordinarily high burden of proof before allegedly sentencing
    a man to death. Yet the lesson of this tradition is not about law. Imam Muslim, who narrated the tradition,
    did not include it in his book of legal judgments and so he did not understand it as setting a legal precedent. So what is the lesson?

    There are a few possible interpretations of the meaning of this incident, but perhaps the best opinion is that
    the Prophet had not intended to kill the man at all. He knew the man was innocent of the charge, so he set up
    a scenario in which Ali and the public would discover the truth for themselves.

    Abu Muhammad ibn Hazm writes:

    من ظن أنه صلى الله عليه وسلم أمر بقتله حقيقة بغير بينة ولا إقرار فقد جهل وإنما كان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يعلم أنه بريء مما نسب إليه ورمي به وأن الذي ينسب إليه كذب فأراد صلى الله عليه
    وسلم إظهار الناس على براءته يوقفهم على ذلك مشاهدة فبعث عليا ومن معه فشاهدوه مجبوبا أي مقطوع الذكر فلم يمكنه قتله لبراءته مما نسب إليه وجعل هذا نظير قصة سليمان في حكمه بين
    المرأتين المختلفتين في الولد فطلب السكين ليشقه نصفين إلهاما ولظهور الحق

    Whoever assumes that the Prophet (s) truly commanded his killing without evidence or due process is ignorant.
    Indeed, he knew the man was innocent of what he was accused, that those who attributed it to him were lying.
    He intended to show people his innocence and for them to agree upon it by witnessing to it. He sent Ali and
    those with him to bear witness that he was a eunuch – his genitalia was cut – so they did not carry out his
    killing due to what was attributed to him. He made this an equivalent lesson to the story of Solomon in his
    wisdom between the two women differing over the child, so he
    brought the knife pretending to cut him into two parts to show them the truth.

    Source: Subul al-Hudá wal Rashād 10/432
    In the famous story of Solomon, peace be upon him, two women both had claimed a child as their own. To resolve
    the dispute, Solomon ordered his companions to bring a knife and cut the child into two pieces. Upon hearing this,
    the real mother relented rather that seeing her child killed, thus the true mother was revealed. He had never planned to harm the child.

    Likewise, the Prophet (s) initially gave the order to kill the man but, being guided by divine revelation,
    he knew that the situation would resolve itself on its own. It was a teaching mechanism for Ali, who would
    later become the fourth of the righteous caliphs and who was famous for his wise judgment. Ali learned not
    to make assumptions of guilt from hearsay alone.

    As in the story of Al-Khidr and Moses in Surat al-Kahf, one should not rush to judgment based merely upon outward
    appearances, but rather one must gather all the facts (i.e. context) before an appropriate conclusion can be made.

    In a similar reading, the man had indeed misbehaved by improperly secluding himself with the concubine Maryah but
    he had not committed adultery, so the Prophet (S) only intended to frighten him for doing so while at the
    same time publicly proving his innocence.
    Ibn al-Qayyim writes:

    وَتَأَوَّلَهُ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى أَنَّهُ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ لَمْ يُرِدْ حَقِيقَةَ الْقَتْلِ إِنَّمَا أَرَادَ تَخْوِيفَهُ لِيَزْدَجِرَ عَنْ مَجِيئِهِ إِلَيْهَا قَالَ وَهَذَا كَمَا قَالَ سُلَيْمَانُ لِلْمَرْأَتَيْنِ اللَّتَيْنِ اخْتَصَمَتَا إِلَيْهِ فِي الْوَلَدِ عَلَيَّ بِالسِّكِّينِ حَتَّى أَشُقَّ الْوَلَدَ بَيْنَهُمَا وَلَمْ يُرِدْ أَنْ يفعل ذلك بل قصد استعلام الأمر من هذا القول

    ولذلك كان من تراجم الأئمة على هذا الحديث باب الحاكم يوهم خلاف الحق ليتوصل به إلى معرفة الحق فأحب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعرف الصحابة براءته وبراءة مارية وعلم أنه إذا عاين السيف كشف عن حقيقة حاله فجاء الأمر كما قدره رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم

    Some interpret the tradition as if the Prophet (s) truly did not intend to kill him. Indeed, he only intended to
    frighten him as a rebuke for coming near to her. They said it was as Solomon had said to the two women
    disputing each other about the child: I will bring the knife until I cleave the child in half. He did not
    intend to do that, but rather his purpose was to make the matter of this statement known.

    For this reason, the Imams understood the lesson of this tradition to be that the judge can pretend to believe
    differently from the truth as a means to arrive at recognition of the truth. The Prophet (s) liked for
    the innocence of the companion to be made known, as well as the innocence of Maryah. He knew that when the
    man saw the sword, he would reveal the reality of his condition and thus the matter concluded as the Prophet had estimated.

    Source: Zad al-Ma’ad 5/15
    In this view, it was from the prophetic wisdom that the Prophet (s) would know that Ali would have discovered the
    truth and arrived at the correct judgement for himself, thereby exonerating both the man and Mariyah
    of the accusations against them.

    Conclusion

    The Prophet knew Ali wasn’t going to kill him and didn’t intend to kill him, he was testing Ali.
