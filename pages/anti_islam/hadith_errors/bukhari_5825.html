    So the claim was brought up from a Hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari 5825:

    So what they (Those who are trying to use it against Islam) are trying to use that claim to point out that women
    were abused, and that Islam allows women to be beaten… other than the fact that we proved Islam doesn’t allow
    beating women
    ﷽
    So if we consider that AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair actually hit her and injured her well,
    that action goes against the Quran verse:

    Oh and if you say that’s a wrong translation for the word “gently”... educate yourself

    Another point I have to cite is:
    The woman was trying to get back with her first husband.  In Islam, if a woman gets divorced or divorces
    herself from her husband through the Islamic court by "Khul’ '", then the only way she can get back with her husband,
    or her husband gets back to her is by her marrying another person and have sexual intercourse with him.
    This is to guarantee that divorce would not be a joke among Muslims..
    Another point:
    The woman was claiming that her second husband was sexually no good.  The husband disputed that,
    and brought his two sons from another marriage as a proof that he can perform sex.  The Prophet ﷺ then told the woman
    "by Allah, these boys resemble him as a crow resembles a crow".
