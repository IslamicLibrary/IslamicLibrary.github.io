    The claim here is ridiculous as they are husband and wife and there is nothing wrong with the hadith,
    during that time it was common for people to keep their clothes mostly on during sexual intercourse,
    which meant that sometimes semen could get on clothes. The hadiths I have seen in Sahih al-Bukhari do
    not say that it was “all over” his clothes, just that that there was one spot that had to be washed.
    Another thing to put in mind is that this wasn’t frequent in ibn majah it used the word maybe that
    indicates it wasn’t that frequent
