    Translation: “ibn batah used this as an argument as giving a slave is better than manumating him, it isn’t
    necessary that freeing a slave is worse than manumating him, it is only because of the possibility that (the relative)
    is old or miskin.”

    -Source: Fathul Bari (8/238)

    People can say “but still doesn’t free him” you have a servant would you rather free him or give him to someone who
    needs if the servant isn’t fully deservant ? Also that is only the case if you no longer have needs in him but
    if he deserves it he must be freed
