    This narration found in al-Bukhari is a second part it says fima balaghana from what we have heard from al-zuhri
    who is a tabi’
    Meaning he didn’t live in the lifetime of the prophet so his hadith is mursal meaning he gives information from
    which he has not seen what is the ruling on that
    translation: “Ibn ma’in said: it is nothing and so said Al-shāfī’ī ibn sa’d said the mursal of al-zuhri is worse
    of mursal of others”

    Note, al-Imām Muslim says in Sahīh Muslim,

    ”… And the principle of our saying, and the saying of Ahl al-‘Ilm is Akhbār that are Mursal
    are not a Hujjah, meaning they are nothing.”

    There is another isnad mentioned in sirah ibn ishaq however it has majhools in it that is weak too
    The taqhueeq says the report chain is weak because the sheyookh of abdul malik bin Abdullah are unknown
