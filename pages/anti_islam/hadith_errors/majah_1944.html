    He’s صدوق مدلس in narrations thus we reject this report from him.

    ⬆️so as u see Imam Ahmed said he was Hasan Al-hadith
    Bukhari also was mentioning Ibn Ishaq

    <img src="../../../images/random2/13397.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    As you can see here Ibn Maen weakend Ibn Ishaq like 4 times. Aba Abdillah said Ibn Ishaq was not a hujja
    Imam Al-Nasa’i said he was not strong
    Al-‘Ijli and Ibn Sa’d said that he is thiqa
    but on the bottom right Imam Ahmed Bin Hanbal said that he does tadlees

    <img src="../../../images/random2/13398.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Ibn Al-Madini said he is thiqa, Abu Zur’ah said he is saduq, Muhammed Bin Yahya said he is Hasan Al-Hadith.
    Ibn Hibban mentioned him in his Thiqat (although he was lenient when making tawtheeq)
    So there is a difference of opinion on wether he even was trustworthy or not to begin with.
    But the muhaditeen all agree that he does tadlees

    <img src="../../../images/random2/13399.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339a.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Here you find the original quote from Imam Al-Nasa’i in his book Al-Du’afa Wal Matrukēn page 211
    (where he says that Muhammed Bin Ishaq is not strong)

    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339b.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339c.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339d.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Asma Al-Mudaliseen by Jalal Al-Deen al-Suyuti page 81-82. He mentions Ibn Ishaq in this book
    (a book for narrators who do tadlees) and Ibn Moen weakend him⬆️
    Imam Al-Shafiee said he did tadlees.

    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339e.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339f.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339g.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Here in Tahreer Taqreeb Al-Tahdeeb Volume 3 Pages 211 & 212
    It mentions the name of Muhammed Bin Ishaq, and Ibn Hajar says that he does tadlees.
    And Shu’ayb Al-Arnaot agrees with him and says that he does tadlees, although he is thiqa
    Ibn Maen, Ahmed Bin Hanbal, Sufyan Bin ‘Uyaynah, Ibn Al-Madini say that he is thiqa
    But regardless if he is thiqa or not, we have proven him to be a mudalis.

    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339h.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    now when we go back to the original narration, we see that Muhammed Bin Ishaq who is a mudalis narrates with عن .
    How do we deal with a narration when a mudalis narrates with that (‘An)?

    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339i.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Al-Albani writes that when a mudalis narrates with عن its not a hujja anymore. Cant be used as proof basically.
    So this narration (Sunan Ibn Majah 1944) is rejected.

    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339j.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339k.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Here Shu’ayb Al-Arnaoot in his Tahqeeq of Sunan Ibn Majah weakens this report

    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339l.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339m.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Here is tahqeeq Sunan Al-Darqutni where it says there is tadlees from Ibn Ishaq in it

    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339n.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339o.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random2/1339p.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    These are other scholars such as ibn hazm and al-hamdani etc… weakning the hadith and ibn hazm says it is a lie,
    As for the narration in musnad ahmed where ibn ishaaq doesn’t do tadlis,
    it was weakned by al-arna’ut because even if he didn’t do it he did tafarud and
    there is a lot of critism on this narrator also there are problems with the matn.

    Al-Aloosi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

    With regard to the additional material having been on a page that was kept with ‘Aa’ishah and
    was eaten by the tame sheep, it is a fabrication and lie of the heretics that this was lost as the
    result of being eaten by a tame sheep without being abrogated. This is what it says in al-Kashshaaf.
