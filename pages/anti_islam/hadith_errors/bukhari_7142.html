    Translation: “And al-Khattibi said it could be used as an expression for anything else ,
    here he used the “Ethiopian” as it isn’t reasonable according to the sharia (law) that that happens
    [due to the period of preislamic ignorance people saw them as inferior the moral of the hadith is listen to the ruler
    whoever he is]”

    “O believers! Do not let some ˹men˺ ridicule others, they may be better than them, nor let ˹some˺ women ridicule
    other women, they may be better than them. Do not defame one another, nor call each other by offensive nicknames.
    How evil it is to act rebelliously after having faith! And whoever does not repent, it is they who are the ˹true˺
    wrongdoers.”
    -Source:  Qūr’ān 49:11
    “O humanity! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may
    ˹get to˺ know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you.
    Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware.”
    -Source: Qūrān 49:13

    The Hadeeth means that the black color is not an impediment or a defect but rather that obedience is obligatory to a black ruler,
    as it is to a non-black one, as soon as he assumes authority. The basic requirement is that he governs the affairs
    of people in accordance
    with the Sharee‘ah of Allaah, The Exalted. The Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said in the Farewell Hajj:
    "If a black slave with a mutilated nose
    is appointed to govern you, and he leads you according to the Book of Allaah the Exalted, then listen to him and obey."
    [Muslim] An-Nawawi said: "Scholars underlined that the Hadeeth
    means that as long as the Muslim ruler adheres to the teachings of Islam and calls people to the Book of Allaah,
    it is incumbent on Muslims to obey him."

    Also, the Hadeeth does not suggest that all black people have raisin-like heads; rather, it means that Muslims are
    obliged to obey the Muslim ruler placed in authority over them even if he looks like that.
