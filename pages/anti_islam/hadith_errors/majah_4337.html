    Both hadith were weakned by Darussalam
    The one in ibn majah was also weakned by al-arna’ut in his tahquiq
    For more check :

    Now lets see the argument of lustful why would you need that in paradise and are they sex slaves.
    First of all no hoories are wives not adultery (44:54) , second it is not open check tafsir al-Qurtubi (55:72)
    everyone do it in their place not in open. Now people claim this is the only thing we will be doing in paradise.
    The prophet said

    Sahih al-Bukhari 4779
    Narrated Abu Huraira:
    Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Allah said, 'I have prepared for my pious worshipers such things as no eye
    has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of, and nobody has ever thought of." Abu Huraira added: If you wish you can
    read:-- 'No soul knows what is kept hidden (in reserve) for them of joy as reward for what they used to do.' 32.17.
    Now this isn’t the only thing we be doing we will also be doing a lot of other things like seeing Gods face
    that is the best thing there. Another important thing is that sex isn’t something unpure it is pure if under Gods
    legislation. So this is a pleasure of this world what wouldn’t I not want it there ? Another important thing is
    we don’t care about the Christians view of paradise it isn’t authoritative over us
    Now for the Question what for women
    First off women in nature don’t want multiple husbands and stuff that is there nature , however if a women
    isn’t married ibn uthaymeen said she would be married to someone in paradise nobody is single there
