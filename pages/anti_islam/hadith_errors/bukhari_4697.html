    meaning that Allaah Alone has knowledge of that so long as it has not yet been fully formed.
    But once the foetus is fully formed, then others may have knowledge of it. Ibn Katheer
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his tafseer of the aayah from Soorat Luqmaan:
    “No one knows what Allaah wants to create in the wombs apart from Him, but once He decrees that
    it should be male or female, doomed or blessed, the angels who are appointed in charge of it know that,
    and whoever else He wills among His creation.”

    If you have a prenatal blood test (NIPT), you may be able to find out your baby's sex as early as
    11 weeks of pregnancy. Ultrasounds may reveal sex organs by 14 weeks,
    but they aren't considered fully accurate until 18 weeks. If you have CVS at 10 weeks, the results
    will reveal your baby's sex by 12 weeks. If you have an amnio at 16 weeks, you can find out by 18 weeks.
    With IVF, you can find out the sex before you even transfer the embryos.

    Since an ultrasound creates an image of your baby, it can also reveal the sex of your baby.
    Most doctors schedule an ultrasound at around 18 to 21 weeks, but the sex may be determined by ultrasound as
    early as 14 weeksTrusted Source.

    It’s not always 100 percent accurate, though. Your baby might be in an awkward position, which
    makes it difficult to clearly see the genitals. If the technician can’t find a penis, they’ll conclude that
    you’re having a girl and vice versa. But mistakes do happen.
