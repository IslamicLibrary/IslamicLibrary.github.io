    There are 2 claims in this particular hadith first that the prophet was lustful second that the woman is a shaytan
    Translation: “and in sahih muslim there are hadith that Abu al-Zubair didn’t  specify hearing from Jabir bin Abdullah
    such as the hadith of No one carrying armes in mecca , the prophet seeing a women then having intercourse with zainab”

    The hadith were it mentions this story are only found from there narration the more trustworthy don’t include it
    meaning this story is unauthentic
    Translation: “Qadi ‘Iyad and ‘Allamah Nawawi (rahimahumallah) explain that this does not mean that Nabi
    (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) had become affected -Allah forbid- when he saw the woman. Rather Nabi
    (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) showed us and demonstrated what we should do in a case like this.
    He did this so that we too do the same. His actions were meant as guidance.”

    -Source: Sharh Sahih muslim (9/254)

    And an-nawawis explanation of a woman being a shaytan he says the scholars have said that a woman
    throw her tabruj makes a higher level of fitnah
