    The Satanic verses are in the scholarly books of the Muslims, and this is something which is known among the scholars. The non-Muslims use this to prove acceptance of the narration, although this is far from the truth, let’s see what the scholars said about the narrations in Tafsīr and Tārikh.


    al-Tabarī said, “these narrations I have in my books speculate it’s chain and text, do not accept it instantly, as I myself do not know it’s authenticity/reliability”


    Ibn Kamāl said, [Translating meaning, not word for word] the books of Tafsīr are filled with narrations that are fabricated, when these scholars are quoting the narrations, they are not intending to say that it is authentic, rather they are just gathering all they can in their books.


    Now, it can easily be said that the narration being in tons of books amongst the scholars doesn’t mean that it is accepted.

    Muhammad Ibn Ishāq the famous Mudalis has reported the story in his book, al-Sīrah al-Nabawīyyah, does this mean he believed in it? Let’s see what he himself said about it.


    It was said that he [Muhammad Ibn Ishāq] himself wrote a book refuting the story, and called it a lie from the Zanādiqah! This is also important to remember, as said earlier, the scholars quoting it in there books doesn’t mean they accepted it.

    Now, let’s deal with the chains of this report. Why did the Muslim scholars weaken it? Was it because of there desires? Let’s see why.

    al-Imām al-Hāfidh Ibn Kathīr says in his Tafsīr that this report all come from the route of Marasīl, and none of the chains of this report are authentic. In addition, al-Qurtubī also says in his Tafsīr that there’s nothing authentic in these narrations, they are all weak and rejected.

    This means there was a Tabi’ī who attributed it to the Prophet ﷺ without a Sahābī in the chain, as it’s not possible for a Tabi’ī to report directly from the Prophet. In addition, since there is no Sahābī in the chain to connect the Marasīl from the Tabi’īeen, the narration’s automatically become acceptable to Ahl al-Hadīth, as they only accept Marasīl from Sahābah. [See the beginning of the highlight from second page].

    Now, let’s get into the chains that the report has come to us with, and prove there weakness.

    The First variant of the chain is containing a man called Abī al-‘Ālīyyah, and he is the one who is narrating the incident. First of all, this man was born 18 years after the incident happened, how would it be possible for him to narrate it? One could say someone told him, and we agree, but who told him? Since we can’t verify the individual who told him, meaning whether if he’s trustworthy or not, then the narration is unacceptable. This narration is Mursal, not accepted since there’s no Sahābī to connect it.

    Another variant of the event comes from Muhammad Ibn K’ab al-Qurathī, and he was born 38 years after the event took place, so who did he get it from? We don’t know, therefore narration is mursal. He also narrated another variant of the report, and the same response is given.

    [Continuation]

    Qatādah also narrates the incident, he was born 70 years after the incident, so who did he get it from? We don’t know. Again it’s Mursal. Even if it was to be an authentic Isnād, Qatādah is from the Mudalisīn whom their reports are not accepted from.

    Another variant of the incident which is mostly quoted comes from Sa’īd Ibn Jubayr, he was born almost 54 years after the incident, so again it’s Mursal, we have no idea where he got it from. The Kuffār respond by quoting a chain where he is connecting it to Ibn ‘Abbas, only issue is Ibn Abbas was born 3 years after the event took place, so how is he going to witness it?

    [Continuation]

    In al-Imām ad-Dārimī’s book, Naqd al-Dārimī ‘Alā Bishr al-Marīsī, the Noter says about the chain from Sa’īd Ibn Jubayr to Ibn ‘Abbas, it is from the worst of chains. It is either weak or fabricated.

    [Continuation]

    Another variant they bring,

    From Āmīyyh Ibn Khālid said, from Shu’bah, from Abī Bishr [Sadūq but was well known for being a Shī’i], From Sa’īd Ibn Jubayr To Ibn Abbas, where I doubt how/if he heard it.

    The scholar then comments on the narration, "And we do not know that this Hadith is transmitted with a connected chain to the Prophet so its mention is permissible except by this chain and we do not know of any other source for this Hadith from Shu'bah... except through Umayyah..."

    As we see here, there is doubt in the chain from the narrator, Sa’īd Ibn Jubayr. In the science of hadīth, if narrator himself doubts the wusūl, the narration is no longer acceptable.

    [Continuation]

    al-Bazzar, the scholar who quoted the chain, said in the yellow, ".. Apart from Umayyah, he [Yusuf Ibn Hammad] narrated from Abu Bishr from Sa'eed Ibn Jubayr a disconnected [report], and this Hadith is also known from Al Kalbi from Abu Salih from Ibn 'Abbas, and Umayyah is a famous thiqah [narrator]."

    Who is al-Kalbī? Is he Thiqah? Let’s see… al-Qadī ‘Iyyad said he was a liar, and his narrations are nothing. Essentially what’s being said is he is extremely weak.

    <img src="../../../images/random2/clei.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    [Continuation]

    al-Imām Ibn al-Jawzī rejected the story and said there is nothing authentic about it, it is not possible for the Prophet to do such an act, and he is infallible. He also says “Even if one was to argue that it is authentic, it would be said that the Shayātīn recited it like this, and some heard it in this manner” Note that this is something Ibn Hajar al-ʿAsqalānī said.

    al-Imām al-‘Ādil said in his book, quoting Imām al-Khatīb, Ahl al-Tahqīq have said, This report is from the fabrications and lies.

    Another full isnad to this story but it has a majhool it was criticized in nasb al-majanik

    <img src="../../../images/random2/clel.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    What is the meaning of 22:52 then if قصة الغرانيق is all a fabrication and lie?

    al-Imām Fakhr al-Dīn ar-Râzi said in his Tafsīr,
    ”And if it is explained as referring to inner thoughts and desires, then it means that if the Prophet wished for some things, Shaytan tries to tempt him with falsehood and call him to that which he should not be called to, then Allah the Exalted overrides this and makes it futile and guides him away from the temptations."

    <img src="../../../images/random2/clem.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    al-Imām al-Mujjadid ash-Shawkānī said,

    "And if we assume that the meaning of تمنى is wishing [something for] himself as is stated by Al-Farra and Al-Kisa’i, then this means that if he desires for himself something, Shaytan speaks and makes the people hear [something] that which did not come from the tongue of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family."
