    First of all abrogation Isn’t corruption as corruption is changing the original meaning done by someone else now if the author willed to what is the problem. Also

    The wisdom behind the gradual prohibition was that Arab society in the beginning was not ready to abandon drinking alcohol. They needed to strengthen their faith in order to overcome their desire to drink.

    Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said:

    وَلَوْ نَزَلَ أَوَّلَ شَيْءٍ لَا تَشْرَبُوا الْخَمْرَ لَقَالُوا لَا نَدَعُ الْخَمْرَ أَبَدًا وَلَوْ نَزَلَ لَا تَزْنُوا لَقَالُوا لَا نَدَعُ الزِّنَا أَبَدًا

    If the first verse to be revealed was to not drink wine, they would have said we will never stop drinking. And if it had been revealed to not commit adultery, they would have said we will never stop committing adultery.
