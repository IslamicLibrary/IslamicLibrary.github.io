    Many people claim the prophet entered upon um haram and um salam while they weren’t married
    In fathul-bari sharhu Sahih al-bukhari (7/113): “the prophet only entered upon her because she was from his mihrams”

    in sharh Sahih muslim (16/85): “and the scholars have agreed that um haram and um salim are haram for him peace be upon him”

    Same thing said by ibn abdul bar in al-tamhid (1/227)
    Another claim in the hadith is the prophet having lice
    In sharh al-muwata’ (3/62) it states:”you search the hair of his head to take out the vermin or to clean, and it differed whether there were lice and did not harm him or was not in it at all? Rather, he slips his garment to clean from the dust, but he used to enter it and enable it to escape, because it is forbidden to him, because she is the aunt of his father or grandfather Abdul Muttalib because his mother is one of the sons of the carpenter.”
