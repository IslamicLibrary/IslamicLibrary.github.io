    It is alleged that some Hadiths have been copied from Jewish sources by Abu Hurairah, who changed it slightly and applied it to Muhammad (peace be upon him). Let’s see if this is true.



    Hadith of the Black Child


    “Narrated Abu Huraira:

    A bedouin came to Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) and said, “My wife has delivered a black child.” The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, “Have you camels?” He replied, “Yes.” The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “What color are they?” He replied, “They are red.” The Prophet (ﷺ) further asked, “Are any of them gray in color?” He replied, “Yes.” The Prophet asked him, “Whence did that grayness come?” He said, “I think it descended from the camel’s ancestors.” Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), “Therefore, this child of yours has most probably inherited the color from his ancestors.””

    — Sahih al-Bukhari 6847

    <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6847">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6847</a>

    The critic may quote Genesis Rabbah to show that Abu Hurairah copied from Jews. However, the conclusion of Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi is totally different to that of the Prophet, as he actually says that it is due to the white portraits in his home as to why he has a white son. The story in Genesis Rabbah is as follows:
    👇

    “It happened once that a black man married a black woman and she had a white child. The father took the child to Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi and said: “Maybe this isn’t my son?” He (Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi) said: “Do you have portraits in your house?” He (the black man) said: “Yes.” (Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi) asked: “Of black or white (people)?” He (the black man) said: “White.” He (Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi) concluded: “This is why you have a white son.”

    Though there are similarities in the stories (both have a man who is confused as to why his wife gave birth to a child of a different color), the conclusion is completely different.
    ——

    Also by the way, Abu Huraira is not the only person that narrates this Hadith. It was also narrated by Ibn Umar: 👇

    “It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that a man from the desert people came to the Prophet and said: “O Messenger of Allah, my wife has given birth on my bed to a black boy, and there are no black people among my family.” He said: “Do you have camels?” He said: “Yes.” He said: “What color are they?” He said: “Red.” He said, “Are there any black ones among them?” He said, “No.” He said: “Are there any grey ones among them?” He said- “Yes.” He said, “How is that?” He said: “Perhaps it is hereditary.” He said: “Perhaps (the color of) this son of yours is also hereditary.””

    — Sunan Ibn Majah 2003

    <a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2003">https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2003</a>

    So as we can see this hadith is not on the authority of Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him), but rather it is narrated by Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) through a totally different chain! The chain goes as follows:

    Imam Ibn Majah >Abu Kurayb > Abaatu bin Kulayb Al-Laythi Abu Ghassan > Juwayriyya bin Asma’a > Na’fiin > Ibn Umar (RA) (as a direct witness to this event)

    This shows that Abu Huraira did not make up any story at all from the influence of Jewish texts, but rather this was a real-life incident that happened with the Prophet, and we have two witnesses: Ibn Umar and Abu Huraira.




    Hadith of Moses pbuh’s death

    “Narrated Abu Huraira: The angel of death was sent to Moses and when he went to him, Moses slapped him severely, spoiling one of his eyes. The angel went back to his Lord, and said, “You sent me to a slave who does not want to die.” Allah restored his eye and said, “Go back and tell him (i.e., Moses) to place his hand over the back of an ox, for he will be allowed to live for a number of years equal to the number of hairs coming under his hand.” (So, the angel came to him and told him the same). Then Moses asked, “O my Lord! What will be then?” He said, “Death will be then.” He said, “(Let it be) now.” He asked Allah that He bring him near the Sacred Land at a distance of a stone’s throw. Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said, “Were I there I would show you the grave of Moses by the way near the red sand hill.”

    — Sahih al-Bukhari 1339

    <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1339">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1339</a>

    The critic may claim that Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) plagiarized the Jewish texts and took from them directly relating to God’s servant Moses(peace be upon him) regarding his death.

    However, this was not narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira but rather he was narrating on the authority of Muhammad pbuh. This is demonstrable by simply quoting the narration in Imam Muslim’s collection. The narration says:
    👇

    ‎“حدثنا ابو هريرة عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم”
    “Abu Huraira narrated to us on the authority of the Prophet”

    — Sahih Muslim 2372b

    <a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2372b">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2372b</a>

    Abu Huraira narrated this directly from the Prophet. Just because he was retelling this story does not mean he was narrating on his own authority, as the evidence has already shown in the Hadith in Sahih Muslim. Abu Hurairah narrated upon the authority of the messenger of God.

    Similarity in text does not imply plagiarism. We know that most of the stories of the Qur’ān, where there is clear knowledge of past scriptures, and also stories of prophets were mostly revealed in Mecca.

    Look at this site for more information regarding that —> <a href="https://tanzil.net/docs/revelation_order">https://tanzil.net/docs/revelation_order</a>

    Mecca was a place where there were no Jews or anyone possible to have been teaching the Prophet these stories. Let’s say this hadith was narrated in Medina. The hostility between Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Jews was extremely high. The Jews hated him and plotted against him and even eventually had full scale war with him. Why would a Jew teach him or Abu Hurairah these things? If they did teach him these things, we would know about it. We pretty much know absolutely everything about the Prophet and who he interacted with. He is the most narrated man in all history. Similarity in text or narrating the same story does not imply plagiarism.
