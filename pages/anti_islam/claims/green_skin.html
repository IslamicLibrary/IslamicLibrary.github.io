    There is nothing in the mentioned hadeeth that indicates that Muslim women were tortured and beaten by their husbands and that it was common during the lifetime of the Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, let alone him approving or denouncing it. The statement of ‘Aa'ishah  may  Allaah  be  pleased  with  her "I have not seen anyone suffering as much as the believing women," means suffering life's hardships, according to Al-Qastallaani in his book Irshaad As-Saari Lisharh Saheeh Al-Bukhari (8/435).
    ‘Aa'ishah's statement, "Her skin is greener than her clothes!" may refer to the marks caused by a beating, and it may also mean that she was emaciated (very skinny). Al-‘Ayni  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  him commented on the hadeeth, saying, "The greenness of the skin could have been because she was very skinny or because she was beaten by her husband ‘Abd Ar-Rahmaan." [‘Umdat Al-Qaari Sharh Saheeh Al-Bukhari 6/22]
    Scholars brought forth this hadeeth as evidence supporting the fact that in case of an irrevocable divorce with major separation (third divorce), it is impermissible for the divorced couple to remarry until the woman marries another man and that second marriage is consummated (and she later becomes divorced or widowed and wishes to remarry her first husband). The scholars' concern for this hadeeth was in relation to this religious ruling. As for the ruling on beating wives, it is known from many other texts indicating that it is absolutely prohibited for the husband to severely beat his wife under any circumstances and that the permissible disciplinary beating is not severe and is deemed allowable in certain cases as the last resort after exhorting her and then abandoning her in bed.
    It has been reported on the authority of Jaabir  may  Allaah  be  pleased  with  him that the Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, "…If they do that, then beat them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark." [Muslim]
    The Maaliki scholar Ad-Dardeer  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  him wrote:
    "Exhortation means to gently advise the disobedient wife to obey her husband and avoid the mistakes that she is making. If exhortation proves to be ineffective, then the husband is entitled to abandon her in bed, i.e. refrain from engaging in intimacy with her, in the hope that she reconsiders her actions and refrains from her disobedience. If forsaking her in bed proved to be ineffective, then it is deemed allowable for the husband, as a last resort, to discipline her by lightly beating her without causing any physical harm. Beating in this context must be without hurting, breaking a bone, or leaving marks on the body, while avoiding hitting the face or especially sensitive places at any cost. It is impermissible for the husband to severely beat his wife even if he knew that it is the only effective way to make her stop her disobedience. If he did do so, then she is legislatively entitled to request a divorce and he is liable for Qisaas (retribution). The order of these stages of disciplining methods must be followed, and the husband should not opt for a latter method unless he believes that the former one is ineffective."
    It should be noted that although it is allowable for the husband to beat his disobedient wife in certain situations, it is better to avoid doing so. Al-Bayhaqi  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  him wrote, "Ash-Shaafi‘i commented on the version of the hadeeth narrated on the authority of Abu Sa‘eed, saying, 'It seems that the Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, forbade beating as a choice and deemed it allowable only in case he fears her aggravated disobedience and that his choice for them was that they do not beat, as he said, 'The best of you will not beat (their wives).'" [Ma‘rifat As-Sunan wal-Aathaar]
