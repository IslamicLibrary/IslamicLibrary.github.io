    First of all this is from wars before addressing claims not peaceful non believers
    Al-Miswar ibn Makhramah reported: During the period of ignorance, Al-Mughirah accompanied some people, killed them, and took their wealth. Then, he later embraced Islam. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “As for your Islam, we have accepted it. As for the property, it is the wealth of treachery and we have no need for it.”

    Source: Sunan Abī Dāwūd 2765

    Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Albani

    Al-Azimabadi said, “The benefit in the tradition is that it is not lawful to seize the wealth of an unbeliever deceptively in a condition of safety. Indeed, it is only lawful to do so against a warrior or combatant.”

    Source: ‘Awn al-Ma’būd 2765
    So did the prophet just fight wars to gain this of-course not

    Ibn taymiyah writes:

    “And his seerah was that all of who alleged treaty and didn’t fight him from the disbelievers, he (PBUH) didn’t fight him and that is in the books of sirah hadith tafsir fiqh and maghazi and it is mutawatir (mass transmitted) in his sirah. So he never started to fight any of the disbelievers so if Allāh ordered him to fight every kaffir then he would have done the negation of this.”

    [Qa’idah mukhtasarah fi qital al-kuffar pg.134]
    Now refuting the claim that he got any money from it from the following hadith
    Narrated Amr ibn Abasah:

    The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in prayer facing a camel which had been taken in booty, and when he had given the salutation, he took a hair from the camel's side and said: I have no right as much as this of your booty, but only to the fifth. and the fifth is returned to you.

    -Source: Sunan Abi Dawud 2755
    Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to (Al-Albani)
    Meaning is confirmed also by ‘Awn al-ma’bud a commentary on Sunan Abi dawud.
