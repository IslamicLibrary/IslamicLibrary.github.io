    This is a brilliant ayah of Al Quran. It reflects how good Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs character was. Prophet couldn‚Äôt say no to his fellow neighbors and followers even though he was working hard whole day (busy in preaching, prophetic duties). Allah loved this characteristic of prophet. So to honor prophet Allah said to all people that prophet is not like any regular person and everyone should think before saying anything to prophet or doing things without his approval. People liked to enter prophet‚Äôs room even without asking and prophet couldn‚Äôt say no because he was friendly and loving. People also used to eat with prophet. Even though prophet was sometimes tired but he never said to his fellow people that he is busy or come later. So Allah told people to ask for permission before entering prophet‚Äôs house and also told not to get busy with chatting after finishing meal. Allah also commanded that if anyone wants something (household things, food etc) from Prophet‚Äôs wives then he should lower his gaze before asking. Also Prophet‚Äôs wives are our mothers (mother of the believers), so it is forbidden to marry one of prophet‚Äôs wife after prophet‚Äôs death. This is all Allah‚Äôs command.

    First of all just because a verse helps the Prophet peace be upon him and makes his life easier that doesn‚Äôt mean that the Prophet peace be upon him made up the Quran. This is a fallacy known as circumstantial ad hominem.

    Secondly there are many verses in which Allah admonishes the prophet peace be upon him (see Quran 80:1-10, Quran 8:67, Quran 9:84, etc) so it‚Äôs not like the Quran is always favorable towards him

    Thirdly there are also verses in which Allah has given the Prophet peace be upon him that would make his life harder like the command to perform Qiyam ul layl (see Quran 17:79) and the fact that verse clearing Aisha ra from slander came a month later (see Quran 24:11)

    Lastly I‚Äôm gonna prove that Muhammad peace be upon him couldn‚Äôt have made up Quran 33:53 in order to help him

    There are authentic Hadiths that show that the prophet peace be upon him had a very shy character
    üëá

    Abu Sa'id Khudri reported that Allah's Messenger (Ô∑∫) was more modest than the virgin behind the curtain (or in the apartment), and when he disliked anything, we recognised that from his face.

    Source: Sahih Muslim 2320

    Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:
    The Prophet (Ô∑∫) was more shy than a virgin in her separate room. And if he saw a thing which he disliked, we would recognize that (feeling) in his face.

    Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 6102

    Now that we established that Prophet peace be upon him was a very shy individual why would a shy person make up Quran 33:53? If anything wouldn‚Äôt making a verse like this be more harm than good because it has a possibility of offending his guests something that Muhammad peace be upon him would never want to happen?

    Also why would Muhammad peace be upon him need to make up a revelation in order to solve this issue. He could have easily just respectfully told his guests to leave and they would have obeyed since he is the prophet. So creating a verse isn‚Äôt necessary
    What makes sense is that since the Prophet peace be upon him had a very shy personality Allah intervened in this situation because the prophet‚Äôs shyness could be detrimental since there could be guests in the future that could take advantage of him, or there could have been guests in the future with ill intentions or the guests hanging out for so long could prevent Muhammad peace be upon him from performing other responsibilities, etc

    Why Couldn‚Äôt the Prophet peace be upon him‚Äôs Wives Marry After He Died?

    The wisdom behind this decree has been highlighted by the scholars. For instance, Al-Qurtubi wrote in his Tafseer,

    ‚ÄúAllaah The Exalted forbade marrying the wives of the Prophet after his death and declared them as Mothers of the believers. This is one of the special privileges granted to the Prophet to preserve his honor and emphasize his high status to the Muslims ‚Ä¶ . It was also said that the wives of the Prophet were not permitted to remarry after him because they will be his wives in Paradise, as the woman will be the wife of her last husband in Paradise. It was narrated that Huthayfah said to his wife, "If you want to be my wife in Paradise, don't marry anyone after my death. A woman will be with her last husband in Paradise."‚Äù
    ‚Äî-

    Ibn Kathir says:

    ‚ÄúHence the scholars were unanimous in stating that it was forbidden for anyone to marry any of the women who were married to the Messenger of Allah at the time when he died, because they are his wives in this world and in the Hereafter, and they are the Mothers of the believers, as stated previously.‚Äù
