    The Biblical God hates people

    Disclaimer:
    Only use this note when Christians complain about the fact that Allah hates people in the Quran


    ❗️God hates Esau

    “but Esau I have hated. I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert.”
    (‭‭Malachi‬ ‭1‬‬:‭3‬)

    “As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God’s part? By no means! For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
    (‭‭Romans‬ ‭9‬‬:‭13-15‬)


    ❗️God hates evil rulers

    “The Lord says, “All their wickedness began at Gilgal; there I began to hate them. I will drive them from my land because of their evil actions. I will love them no more because all their leaders are rebels.”
    (‭‭Hosea‬ ‭9‬‬:‭15‬)



    ❗️God hates the wicked and his enemies

    “O Lord, shouldn’t I hate those who hate you? Shouldn’t I despise those who oppose you? Yes, I hate them with total hatred, for your enemies are my enemies.”
    (Psalms‬ ‭139‬‬:‭21-22‬)

    “The Lord tests the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.”
    ‭‭(Psalm‬ ‭11:5‬)



    ❗️God hates all who do evil

    “For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; evil cannot remain with you. Those who brag cannot stand before your eyes, you hate all who do evil,”
    ‭‭(Psalms‬ ‭5:5-6‬)
    ——

    ❗️God does not love those who don’t dwell in wisdom

    “For God loves none but those who dwell with wisdom.”
    (‭‭Wisdom‬ ‭7:28)


    ❗️God loves only those who keep the commandments which means disbelievers are out:

    “Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.”
    (‭‭John‬ ‭14‬‬:‭21‬)



    ❗️God hates the Pagan nations

    “You must not live according to the customs of the nations. I am going to drive out before you. Because they did all these things, I abhorred them.”
    (Leviticus 20:23)

    “I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars and pile your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols, and I will abhor you.”
    (Leviticus 26:30)


    ❗️God hates false witnesses

    “There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a person who stirs up conflict in the community.”
    (Proverbs 6:16-19)
    ——

    ❗️God hates those that are not disciplined

    “because the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son. Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father? If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all.”
    (Hebrews 12:6-8)

    Notice that:

    - God disciplines those whom He loves.
    - There are those who are not disciplined.

    The conclusion logically follows and that is:

    - There are those whom God does not love.

    John Gill in his commentary stated:

    “All men are not the objects of God's love, only a special people, whom he has chosen in Christ; for whom he has given his Son, when they were sinners and enemies; whom he quickens and calls by his grace, justifies, pardons, and accepts in Christ; and whom he causes to love him; these he loves with an everlasting and unchangeable love, and in a free and sovereign way, without any regard to any motive or condition in them. (John Gill, The New John Gill Exposition of the Entire Bible, Commentary on Hebrews 12:6, Source)”
    ——

    ❗️God hates those who don’t believe Jesus is lord

    “For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
    (Romans 8:38-39)

    This verse is speaking about how God's saints will never separate from the love of God. The verse makes it clear that the love of God is in "Christ Jesus". It is because those saints take Jesus as their Lord and Savior that they will not be separated from the love of God.


    Notice that:

    - One will not be separated from God's love if he believes in Christ Jesus as Lord.
    - There are those who do not believe in Christ Jesus as Lord.

    The conclusion logically follows and that is:

    There are those whom God does not love.




    ❗️God hates those who disobey his laws

    “If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the LORD your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your forefathers.  He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land-your grain, new wine and oil-the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land that he swore to your forefathers to give you.”
    (Deuteronomy 7:12-13)


    Notice that:

    God will only love those who obey His laws.
    There are those who don't obey God's laws.

    The conclusion comes logically:

    There are those whom God does not love.
