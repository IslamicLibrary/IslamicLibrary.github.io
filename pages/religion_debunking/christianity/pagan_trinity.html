        As Martin Luther himself rightly stated,

        “It is indeed true that the name ‘Trinity’ is nowhere to be found in the Holy Scriptures, but has been conceived and invented by man.”

        The Dictionary of the Bible (bearing the Catholic Church’s official seals of approval) reads:

        The trinity of God is defined by the Church... was reached only in the 4th and 5th centuries AD and hence is not explicitly and formally a biblical belief.

        The New Catholic Encyclopedia, likewise reveals that discussions of the Trinity within a first-century context are acutely anachronistic

        Bruce Metzger, one of the 20th century’s most respected and influential scholar on the New Testament, «…the Trinity is such an important part of LATER Christian doctrine…»

        Another Scholar writes,

        “The doctrine is not found in any document or relic belonging to the church of the first three centuries... So far as any remains or any records of them are preserved, coming down from early times, are, as regards this doctrine, an absolute blank.”

        It'd be plausible to say that the doctrine of Trinity in Christianity was influenced by other pagan religions.

        The Babylonians recognized the Trinity.

        The Hindus had a Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu & Shiva.

        The Egyptians had a Trinity as well, as an expert on the Egyptian Religions recognize,
        There are many more examples, but the point is made.

        If you think the above comparison was unjust, let's look at what a world respected Christian debater used for anology, when asked about the Trinity:
        <a href="https://youtu.be/Gp4L9um9uRY">https://youtu.be/Gp4L9um9uRY</a>

        watch from 0:45 until 1:06
        In conclusion, the Trinity is not what Jesus عليه السلام Taught, but rather a later development which was influenced by ancient religion and Philosophies.

        Believers During Tertullian’s Time Accused Him of Polytheism When He Spoke of the Trinity
        Tertullian (died year 220 on christian calendar) is known as the first writer to speak of a "trinity"

        In his book, Against Praxeas, he says the majority of believers reject his idea and accuse him of worshiping multiple gods

        newadvent.org/fathers/0317.h…

        <img src="../../../images/random/91ak.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

        This indicates the trinity wasn't some accepted norm or widespread belief but a newly introduced minority view that was rejected as polytheism by the great mass of believers.

        Original Christians didn’t believe in a Trinity

        Christian theologian J.N.D Kelly states in his book "Early Christian Doctrines" that the original Christians did not believe in Trinity.

        This is what actual PhD Christian theologians say.
