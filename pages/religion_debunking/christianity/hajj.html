    Bacca is one of the names of Makkah, so this is an answer to those who claim it was built during the time of the prophet pbuh

    Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 96

    إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَیۡتࣲ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِی بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكࣰا وَهُدࣰى لِّلۡعَـٰلَمِینَ﴿ ٩٦ ﴾

    • Dr Mustafa Khattab (The Clear Quran):
    Surely the first House ˹of worship˺ established for humanity is the one at Bakkah—a blessed sanctuary and a guide for ˹all˺ people.

    •Tafsir ibn Kathir

    Allah said,
    إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ
    (Verily, the first House appointed for mankind) for all people, for their acts of worship and religious rituals. They go around the House in Tawaf, pray in its vicinity and remain in its area in Itikaf.
    لَلَّذِى بِبَكَّةَ
    (was that at Bakkah,) meaning, the Kabah that was built by Ibrahim Al-Khalil, whose religion the Jews and Christians claim they follow. However, they do not perform Hajj to the house that Ibrahim built by Allah's command, and to which he invited the people to perform Hajj.



    <h1>Valley of Baka and the Law Giver Prophecy (Psalm 84:6)</h1>

    King David says in Psalm 84 about People being Blessed who dwell in the,

    ‎a. “Bayth” (House) of God.

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0126.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    b. They Do Pilgrimage

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0127.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    c. Pass by a Valley called “Baka”

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0128.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    d. The Aramaic goes on saying they make it “a Dwelling place”

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0129.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    e. The Aramaic and LXX adds, the “Law-giver” Shall grant blessings

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0130.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    We Know from the Qur'an

    a. Kaa'ba is the House of God
    b. Muslims do pilgrimage here
    c. Bakkah is the original name of Mecca

    “A single day here is better than a Thousand elsewhere,”

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0131.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    The Prophet ﷺ said a single Salah (prayer) at his mosque and Makkah is more than 1,000 & 100,000 elsewhere

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0132.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    We know King David used to go to the
    a) House of God
    b) do Hajj (Pilgrimage)
    c) Dwelt in Arabia.

    Makes even more sense,

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0133.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0134.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0135.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Moses went to Mount Sinai (Which is Arabia) and Did “Hajj” (Pilgrimage, going around in Circles, Circuits)

    Another coincidence?

    Interestingly in Psalm 84:6 Aramaic and LXX version we have a “Law-giver” (as saw above)

    In Psalm elsewhere we have a Law-giver for the Gentiles

    In Genesis 33 we know of a Law-giver Prophecy from Paran (Augustine of Hippo said this is a Future Prophecy)

    Another coincidence?

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0142.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    In Isaiah 60, God talks about Light shining, Nations coming, especially Kedar sacrificing at God's alter and glorifying his House.

    When did Arabs went to God's alter sacrificing and glorifying his house? It's obviously talking about Kaa'ba, as and we sacrifice at Hajj

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0143.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0144.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0145.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">


    In the book of Jubilees and Asumption of Moses (books which the Authors of the Bible cite) mentions Abraham (re)building the House of God at Mecca.

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0146.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0147.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0148.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">


    The Historian pre-dating Muhammad ﷺ mentions about special monument Ishmaelites go to,

    ‎“Diodorus of Sicily”

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0149.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    We have the Holy Zamzam water Well, in Gen 16:14 as well.

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0150.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0151.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    <h2>Now answering some common objections,</h2>

    a. “It says Valley of Weeping in Psalm 84”

    Even if you translate “Bakkah” into Weeping, it'll still make sense, because Ishmael and his mother wept there.

    Same root word.

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0152.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0153.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    b. “Bakkah mean Balsam Tree”

    Even if you translate it that way, we know from the Bible Ishmaelites were carrying Balsam Trees & Scholars link theese Trees with Mecca.

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0154.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0155.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0156.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0157.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0158.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0159.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    c. “They just Pass by the Valley, the real destination is Israel Zion”

    I've showed the Aramaic version adds they make Bakkah a Dwelling place,

    Zion means Parch land, desert, Monument etc. It's use for alot other places in the Bible for other than Israel, like ark of Tent, etc.

    <img src="../../../images/random4/0160.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0161.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random4/0162.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    d. “Bakka is not Mecca, because in the parallel account in 2 Samuel 5:23 it shows Bakkah was in Palestine”

    The Vulgate say “pear trees” not Bakka

    Biblical Translations themselve are uncertain

    Even in the parallel account of 1 Chronicles 14, it's pear trees not “Bacca”, Jerome held the same view.
