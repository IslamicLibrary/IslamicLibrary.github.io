    The Logical Problem of the Trinity


    P1 The Father is God

    P2 The Son is God

    P3 The Holy Spirit is God

    P4 The Father is not the Son

    P5 The Father is not the Holy Spirit

    P6 The Son is not the Holy Spirit

    P7 There is exactly one God


    These 7 premises form an inconsistent set. In other words, they cannot all be true. However, Christian Trinitarianism affirms all 7 premises. What exactly is the problem? The basic problem is tritheism. If F, S, and HS are God, and not each other, it follows that there are 3 gods.
    â€”â€”

    This then calls into question how the statements are to be analyzed. The key debate is over the phrase "is God" in premises 1 to 3. If "is God" is taken to be an is of identity, then by classical identity F, S, and HS would be identical to each other, which would entail modalism.

    Modalism is a heresy. That's something Christians will want to avoid. Maybe it's an is of relative identity? This would mean that 2 things F and S could be identical to God and yet not identical to each other This violates classical identity and most people are reluctant to do so.
    What about analyzing "is God" in terms of predication? Well, if each person is ascribed the quality of divinity and they are not each other, then we are back to 3 gods. No matter how similar they are in terms of their attributes, will, actions, etc. There may be another option.

    Maybe each person "is God" in the sense that they are "parts" of God. This is William Lane Craig's solution in an attempt to avoid tritheism. However, this is clearly unorthodox as none of the persons is said to possess the divine nature.

    What if all 7 premises are true and we accept that true contradictions exist? This has recently been proposed by JC Beall, but involves denying the law of noncontradiction, which most people will be reluctant to do. As most people will not be likely to reject the LNC or identity.

    Maybe the 7 premises are all true and they are only apparently contradictory, but not actually contradictory. Even if we cannot tell you how or why they aren't contradictory. This is a form of mysterianism, which has been proposed by James Anderson. This isn't technically a "solution" to the LPT. Rather, it is questioning whether or not a solution is required from an epistemological standpoint. Are mysteries acceptable in theology and if so when? How do we determine when something is actually contradictory vs. merely apparently? Questions to consider.

    So, given the brief explanation of the LPT and possible responses, we are left with modalism or denying classical identity with respect to this problem (is of identity option). Tritheism or partialism when it comes to the is of predication option. Denying the LNC or affirming a form of mysterianism and arguing that the LPT may be unsolvable, but Christians are still justified in affirming the doctrine of the Trinity.

    Christians, before making any analogy to explain the Trinity make sure it doesnâ€™t fall under a heresy
