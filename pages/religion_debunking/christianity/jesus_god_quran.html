    This argument is formed of 4 hypothesis
    First Jesus being the word of God in the Qūr’ān however jesus being the word of God means he was created from his word be and he was created (Qūr’ān 3:59).
    The second argument is Jesus being the spirit of God but that isn’t what it is meant first if I ask you who is your spirit from you gonna say from God so you’re the spirit of God also adam is the spirit of God [Qūrān 15:29]. The second meaning is that Jesus was created from the blow of angel Gabriel (19:17-18)
    The third argument is that Jesus makes people alive that also they have no argument in it prophet Abraham prayed to God to make alive and he did [Qūrān 2:260].
    The last argument in that is Jesus creating from clay in Qūr’ān 3:49 however they cut the verse the verse started by saying “and a messenger to isrealites” how can he be a messenger then A God. The word created according to tafsir al-razi means changing or making it look like also creation can come in by the meaning of making. People in the hadith in sahih al-bukhari 2105 “make a live what you have created” also moses did the same thing when he changed the stick to a snake. The creation of God is from nothingness Jesus already clay in the verse. Again this verse doesn’t prove anything
