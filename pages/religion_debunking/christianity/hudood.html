    Biblical Jesus’ brutal punishment for thieves

    Disclaimer:
    Only use this if the Christian complains about Quran 5:38


    ❗️The Biblical Jesus would have no issue with the hand chopping of the thief in Islam. Here are his own words to prove this 👇

    “If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.”
    (Mark 9:43)

    “And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.”
    (Matthew 5:30)

    “If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.”
    (Matthew 18:8)



    If the Christian still complains about the punishment for thieves in Islam, then he/she will hate the Biblical Jesus, because he executed a far worse punishment for thieves, and he also put the hand chopping punishment for other sins

    ❗️Biblical Jesus orders Joshua and the Israelites to stone and burn a thief and his family

    “Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor. Joshua said, “Why have you brought this trouble on us? The Lord will bring trouble on you today.” Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.”
    (Joshua 7:24-25)



    ❗️Biblical Jesus says to chop the hand of a woman if she grabs someone in the private parts

    If two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes him by his private parts, you shall cut off her hand. Show her no pity.
    (Deuteronomy 25:11-12)

    Biblical Jesus would approve of executing the sexually immoral, and them mutilating themselves

    Disclaimer:
    Only use this note when Christians complain about the death penalty for adulterers, and homosexuals, and the flogging for fornicators

    ❗️Biblical Jesus ordered the death of adulterers

     “‘If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death.”
    (Leviticus 20:10)

     “If a man is found sleeping with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel. If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her, you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the young woman because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you.”
    (Deuteronomy 22:22-24)
    ——

    ❗️Biblical Jesus ordered the death of homosexuals

    “If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.”
    (Leviticus 20:13)

    ❗️Biblical Jesus says to rip out your eye if it causes you to sin

    “If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.”
    (Matthew 5:29)

    “And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.”
    (Matthew 18:9)


    ❗️Biblical Jesus will torture adulterers and kill their children

    “So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways. I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.”
    (Revelation 2:22-23)

    Honor Killings in the Bible


    Disclaimer:
    Use this note only if the Christian says that Honor killings are part of Islam when that’s completely false



    ❗️Children who curse their parents will be put to death

    “Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.”
    (Exodus 21:17)


    “‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death. Because they have cursed their father or mother, their blood will be on their own head.”
    (Leviticus 20:9)


    ❗️If a daughter shames her priestly father, she can be killed

    “‘If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she must be burned in the fire.”
    (Leviticus 21:9)

    Jizyah in the Bible


    Disclaimer:
    Only use this note if the Christian complains about the Jizyah in Islam

    The Biblical Jesus did far worse than whatever Christians complain about Quran 9:29


    ❗️Biblical Jesus’s own version of Quran 9:29

    “When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies.This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.”
    (Deuteronomy 20:10-15)



    ❗️The Biblical Jesus and Paul would’ve commanded you Christians to pay Jizyah

    “Then Jesus said to them, “Give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s.”
    (Mark 12:17)

    “Caesar’s,” they replied. Then he said to them, “So give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”
    (Matthew 22:21)

    “He said to them, “Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”
    (Luke 20:25)

    “Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.”
    (Romans 13:5-7)

    Christian Version of Sharia Law Punishments

    Credit to Quran and Bible Blog

    While many modern/liberal Christians, especially those living in the western hemisphere, tend to oppose harsh penalties for certain crimes (as can be seen by their silly arguments against Sharia law), Christians in antiquity did not oppose such penalties, and were in fact supportive of harshness against criminals, even to the point of imposing the torture and death.
    Concerning “public prosecutions”, the Institutiones (Book III, Title XVIII) states that some crimes are capital crimes and others are not. It also states that death can be inflicted by “water and fire”. Other penalties could be “deportation” and “hard labour”.

    Source: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5983/5983-h/5983-h.htm#link2H_4_0102">https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5983/5983-h/5983-h.htm#link2H_4_0102</a>
    ——

    The death penalty applied to such crimes as the following:

    Treason: The death penalty applies to “any design against the Emperor or State”.

    Adultery and homosexuality (emphasis ours): “The lex Julia, passed for the repression of adultery, punishes with death not only defilers of the marriage-bed, but also those who indulge in criminal intercourse with those of their own sex…” The punishment of death for homosexuality, described “the crime against nature”, was again emphasized in the Novellae (Book LXXVII and Book CXLI).
    Sources: <a href="https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/N77_Scott.htm">https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/N77_Scott.htm</a>

    and

    <a href="https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/N141_Scott.htm">https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/N141_Scott.htm</a>

    The lesser crime of “seducing virgins or widows of respectable character” without the use of “violence” was punished with “flogging” and “relegation”. However, if the criminal was “of reputable condition”, the punishment was “confiscation of half his fortune”.

    Assassinations, poisonings, magic, and selling “deadly drugs”: “The lex Cornelia on assassination pursues those persons, who commit this crime with the sword of vengeance, and also all who carry weapons for the purpose of homicide. […] This statute also inflicts punishment of death on poisoners, who kill men by their hateful arts of poison and magic, or who publicly sell deadly drugs.”

    Parricide (killing a parent or relative) and infanticide: While the penalty for these crimes was death, it was not to be by “sword” or “fire”. Rather, the criminal would be “sewn up in a sack with a dog, a cock, a viper, and an ape”and then thrown into the sea!
    Forgery: The crime of forgery had different penalties depending on whether the criminal was a slave or a free person. If he was a slave, the penalty was death. If he was a free man, the penalty was “deportation”.

    Blasphemy: Those who “utter blasphemous words” are to be killed. The Novellae (Book LXXVII, Chapter 1) states:

    “…there are others who utter blasphemous words, and swear by the sacraments of God, and provoke Him to anger, We enjoin them to abstain from these and other impious speeches, and not swear by the head of God, or use other language of this kind. For if blasphemy when uttered against men is not left unpunished, there is much more reason that those who blaspheme God himself should be deserving of chastisement. […] We order the Most Glorious Prefect of this Royal City [Constantinople] to arrest any persons who persist in committing the aforesaid crimes, after the publication of Our warning; in order that this city and the State may not be injured by the contempt of such persons and their impious acts, and inflict upon them the punishment of death.”

    Finally, torture to extract confessions for crimes was allowed by the law.
    Source: See the Digesta, Book XLVIII, Title 18: <a href="https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/D48_Scott.htm#XVIII">https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/D48_Scott.htm#XVIII</a>.

    The Digesta (Book XLVIII, Title 18) even seems to suggest that torturing female criminals is allowed, as long as they are not pregnant. It states, quoting an earlier Roman source, that:

    “the execution of the penalty imposed upon a pregnant woman should be deferred until she brings forth her child. I, indeed, am well aware of the rule that torture must not be inflicted upon her as long as she is pregnant.”
    In fact, in the Codex Justinanus (Book IX, Title 41), torturing a woman who has “destroyed her husband by poison” is explicitly allowed.

    Source: <a href="https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/CJ9_Scott.gr.htm#41">https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/CJ9_Scott.gr.htm#41</a>

    Also, as a general rule, citing Ulpianus, the law was that torture could be applied “for the purpose of detecting crime”, and both slaves and free men could be tortured.

    Source: <a href="https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/D48_Scott.htm#XVIII">https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/D48_Scott.htm#XVIII</a>

    Moreover, “whipping” and “scourging” were allowed in some cases even when the criminal belonged to an “ecclesiastical order”. The Novellae (Book CXXIII, Chapter XX) states that:

    “where more reverend priests or deacons are found to have given false testimony in pecuniary cases, it will be sufficient for them to be whipped, suspended from the discharge of their sacred duties for three years, and confined in monasteries. Where, however, they have given false testimony in criminal cases, We order that after having been expelled from the priesthood, they shall undergo the penalties prescribed by law. When clerks belonging to other ecclesiastical orders have been convicted of having given false testimony in any case whatever, either civil or criminal, they shall not only be deprived of their ecclesiastical offices, but shall also be scourged.”

    Moreover, the permissibility of torturing “vile thieves” was implied in Book VIII, Chapter X, which stated that:

    “…it would be absurd for magistrates, who torture vile thieves and do not relax their efforts until the stolen property is returned, to themselves remain unpunished after having committed the most flagrant thefts…”
