    respected Trinitarian professor reveals that,

    The Bible does not teach the doctrine of the Trinity. Neither the word ‘trinity’ itself nor such language as ‘one-in-three,’ ‘three-in-one,’ one ‘essence’ (or ‘substance’), and three ‘persons’ is biblical language”.

    Christopher Kaiser, provides this stunning confession:

    The Church’s doctrine of the Trinity would seem to be the farthest thing from [Jesus & the NT writers] minds...the doctrine is not found anywhere in the NT; it was not so clearly articulated until the late 4th century AD.

    In 2014, Charisma Magazine published an admission from popular Trinitarian professor, Charles Wagner:

    “We today believe in the Trinity not because of direct biblical revelation but because of majority votes in certain councils—in other words, by extra-biblical revelation.”

    Protestant professor remarks,

    No responsible NT scholar would claim that the doctrine of the Trinity was taught by Jesus or preached by the earliest Christians or consciously held by any writer of the NT.  It was slowly worked out in the course of the first few centuries.

    James strong, Author of the Strong’s Concordance writes,

    Towards the end of the 1st century and during the 2nd, many learned men came over  from Judaism and paganism to Christianity. They brought into the Christian schools of theology their Platonic ideas and phraseology.
    ⬆️⬆️Very interesting🤔

    W.R. Mathews write,

    St. Paul did not know it [the Trinity] , and would have been unable to understand the meaning of the terms used in the theological formula on which the Church ultimately agreed.

    H.G. Wells wrote,

    There is no evidence that the apostles of Jesus ever heard of a Trinity, at any rate from him.

    Emil Brunner, one of the most influential Protestant theologians of the last century,  states with surprising candor,

    We must honestly admit that the doctrine of the Trinity did not form part of the early Christian—New Testament—message.

    Renowned Catholic scholar Graham Greene makes this observation:

    [protestants] claim that no belief should be held dogmatically which is not explicitly stated in Scripture. But they themselve accepted Trinity, for which there is no such precise authority in the Gospels.

    In 2014, Major Triniterian organizations surveyed American evangelists

    The results were “disappointing” demonstrated that “most American evangelicals hold views condemned as heretical by some of the most important councils of the early church.”
    so in conslusion, if Jesus عليه السلام preached any Trinitarian God it'd be obvious, but rather he called to worship Allah alone

    The Logical Problem of the Trinity put in deductive arguments:

    John stated:

    The trinity of God is defined by the Church was reached only in the 4th and 5th centuries AD and hence is not explicitly and formally a biblical belief.

    Another biblical scholar says the samething Here is Bruce Metzger stated simmer stament

    <img src="../../../images/random/919s.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    The doctrine is not found in any document or relic belonging to the church of the first three centuries... So far as any remains or any records of them are preserved, coming down from early times, are, as regards this doctrine, an absolute blank.”

    The Competing Views of the Holy Spirit

    Nowhere in the Bible is it clearly taught that the Holy Spirit is an eternal divine person of God equal to the Father. Neither did the early Church Fathers speak of the Holy Spirit in such a way.

    Gregory of Nazianzus, a fourth century Archbishop and theologian, informs us that even as late as 379 CE, there were many different competing views about the status of the Holy Spirit:
    👇

    “Amongst our own experts, some took the Holy Spirit as an active process, some as a creature, some as God. Others were agnostic on this point out of reverence, as they put it, for Scripture, which has given no clear revelation either way”

    [Gregory of Nazianzus, Oration 31, translated by Lionel Wickham, in St Gregory of Nazianzus On God and Christ: The Five Theological Orations and Two Letters to Cledonius, 117-47, 120 Chapter 5]

    If the divinity of the Holy Spirit was clearly established in the Bible then it would not have taken centuries of Church Councils to establish the doctrine.
    ——

    Apologist Dr. William Lane Craig admits that Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, and others were not Trinitarians

    He claims these church fathers were mislead by middle platonism. Craig also boldy asserts that the Nicene Creed is not Biblical.
