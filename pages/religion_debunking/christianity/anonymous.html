    Consensus of the Greek Bible:

    Raymond Brown states:

    I have already said that I do not think of the evangelists themselves as eyewitnesses of the passion; nor do I think that eyewitness memories of Jesus came down to the evangelists without considerable reshaping and development.

    The Death of the Messiah page 14

    Theopedia sates:

    There is no direct evidence that this John is the son of Zebedee, and some scholars have suggested an alternative ‘John the Elder’. However, there is no direct evidence for the existence of this alternate John, and it is reasonable to assume that early church writers would specify if ‘John the Disciple’ was different to ‘John of Zebedee’, since the latter is so prominent in the Synoptic Gospels.

     Brown 1979, page 34

    Raymond brown:

    Jesus did not write an account of his passion; nor did anyone who had been present write an eyewitness account.
    Available to us are four different accounts written some thirty to seventy years later in the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John, all of which were dependent on tradition that had come down from an intervening generation or generations. That intervening preGospel tradition was not preserved even if at times we may be able to detect the broad lines of its content.  When we seek to reconstruct it or, even more adventurously, the actual situation of Jesus himself, we are speculating.

    The Death of the Messiah, page 4

    Michael David Coogan states:

    Neither the evangelists nor their first readers engaged in historical analysis. Their aim was to confirm Christian faith Scholars generally agree that the Gospels were written forty to sixty years after the death of Jesus. They thus do not present eyewitness or contemporary accounts of Jesus’ life and teachings.
