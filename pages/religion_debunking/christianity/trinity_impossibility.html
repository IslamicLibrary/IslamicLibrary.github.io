    Why the persons of the Trinity cannot exist

    Credit to Keys to the Unseen

    Christians claim that the single God exists as three distinct persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This belief is false because several absurdities follow from it. In this post, I will demonstrate one such absurdity:
    —-

    Premise 1: If the persons of the Trinity exist, then they would be either qualities, or beings.

    Premise 2: The persons of the Trinity are neither qualities nor beings.

    Conclusion: Therefore, the persons of the Trinity do not exist.


    As regards to Premise 1 the reason it’s true is because existent essences either:


    Exist while subsisting within some other essence.
    Exist while not subsisting within some other essence.

    The first option is the negation of the second, so they cannot be both false. And the first case describes a quality, whereas the second case describes a being. As such, it is impossible for that which exists, to be neither a quality nor a being.

    Given the above, and since the Christian claims that the persons of the Trinity exist, this means that the persons of the Trinity would have to be either qualities or beings.

    With regards to Premise 2, if the Christian claims: “the persons of the Trinity are qualities of God, that subsist within His being.”

    We respond: “in that case, there would be no reason to limit them to three persons. If the Christian were consistent, he would have treated other qualities (such as Power, Will, and Knowledge) as divine ‘persons’ as well.”

    Moreover, it is impossible for the qualities of God to separate from Him. Yet the Christian believes that the Son and the Spirit entered the world. So how can he then claim that those persons are qualities?

    And if the Christian claims: “the persons of the Trinity are each a divine being, such that each is attributed with all the divine qualities.”

    We respond: “this is blatant polytheism. In that case, you would be no different than the polytheist who believes in a single family of gods, comprised of a multiplicity of individual deities.”

    Since the two premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows. Therefore, the persons of the Trinity do not exist.
