    Does God have "regrets"/change His mind or doesn't He?

    In Numbers 23:19, it says that God is not like a man that he should "lie" or "change his mind" (ESV). The Hebrew term is "naham", meaning to "regret" or "repent" of something.

    <img src="../../../images/random2/jua1.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">
    <img src="../../../images/random2/jua2.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    It is well-known that God occasionally expresses "regrets" for something he did. Genesis 6:6 (regret for creating mankind) & 1 Samuel 15:35 (making Saul king) are two of the best known examples.

    <img src="../../../images/random2/jua4.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    Now, perhaps these verses use a different word in the Hebrew from Numbers 23:19? NOPE! They use the exact same word: "naham"!

    So, does God have "regrets" like a "son of man" or doesn't he? It depends on which book you read. It is a contradiction.

    How Old Was Ahaz’s Wife?

    Aḥaz produced a child at age nine He became king at age 20 and ruled for 16 years (2K. 16:2). His son Ḥizqiah became king at age 25 (2K. 18:2). That seems to mean that Ḥizqiah was born when his father was 11 years old. (Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 10:7)

    Contradiction in Abraham and Sarah’s Age

    Abraham 2 years older than Sarah's father, Haran begot Sarah when he was 8 years old.

    How much older was Abraham than Sarah? ...he was two years older than her father, Haran. It turns out then that when Haran begot Sarah, he begot her at the age of eight.  (Talmud Sanhedrin 69b)

    Meanwhile, Genesis says both Abraham and Sarah had the same father
    👇

    “Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.”

    (b) 3 sons

    “The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three.”

    A Contradiction in David’s Sins

    According to 1 Kings 15:5, the only sin that David committed was the Uriah the Hittite incident.
    👇

    “For David had done what was right in the eyes of the Lord and had not failed to keep any of the Lord’s commands all the days of his life—except in the case of Uriah the Hittite.”
    (1 Kings 15:5)

    However according to 2 Samuel 24:10, David also committed the sin of counting the fighting men. 👇

    “David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the Lord, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, Lord, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.”
    (2 Samuel 24:10)

    So was David’s only sin the case with Uriah the Hittite, or did David commit other sins as well?

    How Much did David pay for the threshing floor and Oxen?


    (a) 50 shekels of silver

    “But the king replied to Araunah, ‘No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.’
    So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them.”
    (2 Samuel 24:24)





    (b) 600 shekels of gold


    “Araunah said to David, ‘Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this.’ But King David replied to Araunah, ‘No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the Lord what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing.’ So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels of gold for the site.”

    Contradiction on the city of Dan

    According to Judges 18, the city of Dan came into existence after the city of Laish was burned down, then rebuilt, and then was renamed Dan
    👇

    “Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a people at peace and secure. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city. There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there. They named it Dan after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel—though the city used to be called Laish.”
    (Judges 18:27-29)
    However if we go back to Genesis 14, which is long before the time of Judges, the city of Dan apparently exists 👇

    “When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.”
    (Genesis 14:14)

    This is impossible! Dan was not born yet at the time of Genesis 14, so why does the city of Dan exist in the passage? Why is Abraham going to a city that does not exist until centuries later?


    PROPOSED SOLUTIONS AND REBUTTALS:

    The proposed solution is the view that the Dan of Genesis 14:14 is not the Laish conquered by the Danites and then later renamed Dan, but that this Dan was Dan-jaan, a city mentioned in 2 Samuel 24:6. According to this view, the Dan of Genesis 14:14 belonged to Gilead (see Deuteronomy 34:1), and is no doubt the same as the Dan-jaan mentioned in 2 Samuel 24:6 in connection with Gilead

    This view should be rejected for two reasons: First, Josephus in his Antiquities 1:10 mentioned that this Dan was located near one of the sources of the Jordan. In addition, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Septuagint, and Targum Onkelos follow the Masoretic Text.

    Second, many scholars believe that Dan-jaan and Dan were the same city. This view reflects the possibility that the scribes did not preserve the correct name of this city. Some Bible translations accept the identification of Dan-jaan with Dan.

    The following translations translate “Dan” in 2 Samuel 24:8: ESV, RSV, NRSV, Tanak, BBE, Douay-Rheims, NAB, and the NJB.

    The following translations translate “Dan-jaan”: KJV, NIV, NKJV, NLB, CSB, Darby, Geneva, JPS, Webster, and Young.

    Conclusion:

    Dan is anachronistic.

    Anachronism of the Darics



    The Tanakh claims that a gold coin known as the Daric, was used at the time of King David. 👇

    “They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze and a hundred thousand talents of iron.”
    (1 Chronicles 29:7)

    As historians point out, the daric is named after the Persian leader, Darius the Great who lived hundreds of years after King David.

    Even the Jewish Encyclopedia acknowledges this error. 👇

    “A notable instance of anachronism occurs in 1 Chronicles 29:7… gold darics, coins which were not struck before the time of King Darius 1, i.e., more than 400 years after David.”

    Numerical Error in Joshua

    In Joshua 15:21-32, the author is listing cities which belonged to the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward. Let’s count how many cities the author listed.

    “And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur, And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah, And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan, Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth, And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor, Amam, and Shema, and Moladah, And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet, And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah, Baalah, and Iim,and Azem, And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah, And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah, And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages:”

    If we count the cities the author listed, it will lead us to a total of 38 cities, but the author of Joshua instead said that there were 29 cities in total
    👇

    “…all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages:”
    (Joshua 15:32)
    Some biblical scholars try to make apologetic excuses for this obvious error
    👇

    <img src="../../../images/random2/juag.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    The commentator is wrong on every level. For his first point, it’s a very weak excuse. If the uncounted cities doesn’t properly belong to Judah, then why did the author of Joshua listed them as cities which belongs to the tribe of the children of Judah.
    👇

    “And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,”
    (Joshua 15:21)

    The author says nothing about tribes being properly or not properly belonging to Judah.

    As for the commentator’s second point, it’s also a weak excuse. The author mentioned nothing about the cities being walled or unwalled.

    In case someone wants to make another excuse for the error in Joshua 15:21-32, the rest of the verses in Joshua 15 (specifically verses 57-62) the author did count the number of cities and villages correctly.
    👇

    <img src="../../../images/random2/juah.png" alt="Spongebob" height="700px">

    So how come the author couldn’t count correctly in Joshua 15:21-32? The only explanation is that it’s a plain error, no other way around.

    Death of Aaron Contradiction

    According to Numbers 33, the Isrealites travel from Kadesh to Mount Hor, Aaron dies, and then they move to Zalmonah
    👇

    “They left Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the border of Edom. At the Lord’s command Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor, where he died on the first day of the fifth month of the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor. The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming. They left Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.”
    (Numbers 33:37-41)


    However in Deuteronomy 10, the order is the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah Aaron died and was buried, then they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah.
    👇

    “(The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest. From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.”
    (Deuteronomy 10:6-7)

    So where did Aaron die, and where did the Israelites go next?

    How did Saul die?

    (a) He committed suicide

    “Then Saul said to his armorbearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and abuse me.” But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it. And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him. So Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men died together that same day.”
    ‭‭(1 Samuel‬ ‭31:4-6‬)‬‬

    (b) Another man killed him

    “He said to me again, ‘Please stand over me and kill me, for anguish has come upon me, but my life still remains in me.’ So I stood over him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my Lord.”

    Are the Nephilim alive or dead?

    According to Genesis 6:4, the Nephilim were alive on the Earth and according to Genesis 7:23, the Nephilim are killed in the flood
    👇

    “The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.”
    (Genesis 6:4)


    “Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.”
    (Genesis 7:23)

    However if we go to Numbers 13:33, the Israelites scouted out the Promised Land, and  they were shocked and afraid because the Nephilim were there
    👇

    “We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.”
    (Numbers 13:33)

    Calculation Error in Numbers Chapter 3

    In Numbers 3, God orders Moses to count the Levites.
    👇

    “The Lord said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai, ‘Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more.’So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of the Lord.”
    (Numbers 3:14-16)

    So this counting is by God’s command according to the Torah. Now let’s see what the total number will be. In Numbers 3:21-22, when he counted these tribes, the total was 7,500
    👇

    “To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were the Gershonite clans. The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500.”
    (Numbers 3:21-22)

    In Numbers 3:27-28, when he counted these tribes, the total was 8,600.
    👇

    “To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans. The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.”
    (Numbers 3:27-28)

    In Numbers 3:33-34, when he counted these tribes, the total was 6,200.
    👇

    “To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans. The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200.”
    (Numbers 3:33-34)

    If we add 7,500 + 8,600 + 6,200 it will give us a total of 22,300. However if we read Numbers 3, it gives an incorrect calculation.
    👇

    “The total number of Levites counted at the Lord’s command by Moses and Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more, was 22,000.”
    (Numbers 3:39)

    As we can see, the Torah makes a wrong calculation of 22,000 when it should have been 22,300.
    ——

    Anatomy of Insects according to the Torah

    According to Leviticus 11:20-23, it says that all flying insects walk on all fours
    👇

    “‘All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be regarded as unclean by you. There are, however, some flying insects that walk on all fours that you may eat: those that have jointed legs for hopping on the ground. Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket or grasshopper. But all other flying insects that have four legs you are to regard as unclean.”
    (Leviticus 11:20-23)

    Some apologists may try to respond by saying that the part about waking on all fours refers to a different set of legs, and the two legs are the leaping legs.

    What this explanation clearly misses is the fact that when the Bible mentions that “All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be detestable to you.” This group does not include those with leaping legs as shown by the fact that the very next passage states “There are, however, some winged creatures that walk on all fours that you may eat: those that have jointed legs for hopping on the ground.”

    Now if the passages lacked the first half discussing those with no jointed legs, then maybe the explanation might work. But as the biblical text clearly differentiates those with no jointed legs as separate to those with said jointed legs, and yet both groups are defined as having four legs.

    Jacob or Israel?

    According to Genesis 32:28, Jacob will be called Israel from now on, and will no longer be called Jacob: 👇

    “Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”
    (Genesis 32:28)


    However later on in Genesis 46:2, God calls Jacob by his actual name Jacob even though earlier God told him he won’t be called that anymore: 👇

    “And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, “Jacob! Jacob!”
    (Genesis 46:2)

    Flat Earth alluded in Isaiah


    “He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; he will assemble the scattered people of Judah from the four quarters of the earth.”
    (Isaiah 11:12)

    The phrase of interest in this verse is “four quarters of the earth”.  The Hebrew word for “quarters” is   כָּנָף (kanaph), which is defined as an “edge” or “extremity”.

    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H3671&t=KJV">https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H3671&t=KJV</a>

    In other words, when referring to the “earth”, it means the farthest “extremities”.  However, according to Gesenius’ Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon, in this regard the earth is often compared to a “cloak” that is “spread out”.  A cloak, of course, could not be described in any form even remotely resembling a spherical object.  Hence, the suggestion is of a flat surface with four “corners” or “extremities”.  Nevertheless, if we keep in mind that the Hebrew word “erets” does not always mean the entire planet Earth, then it is possible that a flat-Earth cosmology is not necessarily implied.

    However if we go to Isaiah 40:22 we do get this eye catching verse: 👇

    “He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in.”
    (Isaiah 40:22)

    Now why describe the earth as a circle. If Isaiah wanted to describe the earth as spherical, then wouldn’t a better term like “ball” be used instead of “circle.”

    A circle by definition is a flat 2 dimensional disc. Also the writer of Isaiah was aware of the term ball as the word is used in Isaiah 22:18: 👇

    “He will roll you up tightly like a ball and throw you into a large country. There you will die and there the chariots you were so proud of will become a disgrace to your master’s house.”
    (Isaiah 22:18)

    Embarrassing Calculation Errors and Contradictions in Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7

    In Ezra 2:1-64, the author lists names of tribes which have returned from the Babylonian exile. The author provides the population number of each tribe.

    If we go to Nehemiah 7:4-66, we can find that both Ezra 2:1-64, and Nehemiah 7:4-66 are exactly word for word similar by reading the same translation.

    But the problem here is that the names given are exactly the same, but the numbers are different.

    So here we have two biblical passages that are exactly the same, but the numbers are different

    Notice up above that there are 15 contradictions
    when the two passages are compared with each other. If the contradictions are not enough, the author of both these passages calculated their numbers to 42,360. Both calculations are horribly wrong.

    the numbers in both passages to see if we can get the total of 42,360.

    Let’s start with the numbers mentioned in Ezra 2:1-64. Let’s see if it adds up to 42,360
    👇

    2,172 + 372 + 775 + 2,812 + 1,254 + 945 + 760 + 642 + 623 + 1,222 + 666 + 2,056 + 454 + 98 + 323 + 112 + 223 + 95 + 123 + 56 + 128 + 42 + 743 + 621 + 122 + 223 + 52 + 156 + 1,254 + 320
    + 725 + 345 + 3,630 + 973 + 1,052 + 1,247 + 1,017 + 74 + 128 + 139 + 392 + 652

    If we add up all these numbers it will add up to 29,818. It does not equal 42,360

    Now let’s go to Nehemiah 7:4-66, and let’s see if the numbers mentioned adds up to 42,360.
    👇

    2,172 + 372 + 652 + 2,818 + 1,254 + 845 + 760 + 648 + 628 + 2,322 + 667 + 2,067 + 655 + 98 + 328 + 324 + 112 + 95 + 188 + 128 + 42 + 743 + 621 + 122 + 123 + 52 + 1,254 + 320 + 345 + 721 + 3,930 + 973 + 1,052 + 1,247 + 1,017 + 7 + 4 + 148 + 138 + 39 + 2 + 642

    If we add up all these numbers, it will add up to 30,675. It does not equal 42,360

    So as we can see, both passages calculated incorrectly. God cannot make mathematical errors, nor would he inspire people to make them.

    The Tanakh has a historical error with regards to the city of Nineveh
