    I will keep it simple
    Firstly we will go through most of the chapter to establish the context

    Nabi Daniyal A.S saw a dream [verse 1] , in his dream , 4 winds were blowing from the 4 directions of the war , waging war and stirring the great sea [verse 2]
    And four huge beasts were coming up out of the sea, each one different from the other [Verse 3]

    Explanation of the 4 Beasts



    EXPLANATION OF THE FIRST BEAST
    The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle, until its wings were plucked and it was taken from the earth, and it stood on feet like a man, and the heart of a mortal was given it [Verse 4]

    The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle
    It was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle; that is the kingdom of Babylon, which was ruling at that time, and so did Jeremiah see it (4:7): "A lion has come up from its thicket," and he says also (48:40): “like an eagle he shall soar.”

    until its wings were plucked
    Its wings were plucked, which is an allusion to its downfall

    and it was taken from the earth
     an expression of being removed from the earth, an allusion to the curtailment of the kingdom from the world.


    EXPLANATION OF THE SECOND BEAST

    And behold another second beast, resembling a bear, and it stood to one side, and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth, and so did they say to it, 'Get up, eat much meat.' [Verse 5]

    Resembling a bear It is spelled לְדֹב [without a “vav,”] like דִיבָא, the Aramaic for זְאֵב, a wolf, for the kingdom of Persia was also called a wolf, as it is said: (Jer. 5:6): “Therefore a lion smote them, a wolf of the deserts spoils them"

    and it stood to one side: and it stood to one side, indicating that when the kingdom of Babylon terminates, Persia will wait one year, when Media will reign.

    And there were three ribs in its mouth
    3 kings of Persia i.e Cyrus, Ahasuerus, and Darius who built the Temple.
    EXPLANATION OF THE THIRD BEAST
    After this, I saw, and behold another one, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird on its back, and the beast had four heads, and dominion was given it. [ Verse 6 ]

    four wings… four heads They are the four rulers to whom Alexander of Macedon allotted his kingdom at his death , historically this is true and well known

    EXPLANATION OF THE FOURTH BEAST


    After this, I saw in the visions of the night, and behold a fourth beast, awesome and dreadful and exceedingly strong, and it had huge iron teeth. It ate and crushed, and trampled the rest with its feet, and it was different from all the beasts that were before me, and it had ten horns



    It crushed.. and… the rest It ate (annexed) the nations and trampled the ones what it left over from its eating.

    and… ten horns: The angel explained to Daniel that these are the ten kings who would ascend (To the throne) of Rome before Vespasian, who would destroy the Temple. , he explained it in the same chapter few verse later , we will come to it soon
    Note : A hadith says that Rome has 10 horns , but its irrelevant since i am proving it from their scripture


    "I looked at these horns and behold another small horn came up among them, and three of the first horns were plucked out before it, and behold eyes like human eyes were on this horn, and a mouth speaking arrogantly." [Verse 8]

    speaking arrogantly words of arrogance. That is Titus, about whom the Rabbis, said  that he blasphemed and berated and entered the Heichal with brazenness.(Gittin 56b)
    I was looking until thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days sat; His raiment was as white as snow, and the hair of His head was like clean wool; His throne was sparks of fire, its wheels were a burning fire. [Verse 10]


    Ancient of days sat on the throne...
    And there are people who take this verse literally , the throne of God and his sitting i will explain here
    The Hebrew word kisse (throne) simply denotes rank or honour of a king it is for
    It denotes the dominion of a king
    For this reason the prophet A.S wrote "Thus said the lord , heavens are my throne and Earth my footstool" [Isaiah 66:1]
    i.e they denote God's greatness and omnipotence as the throne denotes the greatness of a king
    And in another place it is written "a glorious throne on high from the beginning is our sanctuary" , the sanctuary also denotes the greatness of God thus is called throne of God
    And in another place it is said "For my hand is upon the throne of God" [Exodus 17:16] The throne here denotes the greatness of God again

    The throne of God , however shouldn't be taken as something seperate from God , as it is written "You , O Lord , remain forever , your throne from generation to generation"


    About the sitting of God , this too i will explain
    The primary meaning of the word "Yashab" (Seated) is to sit literally
    A person can best remain motionless and at rest position while sitting, this term is applied to everything that is unchanging
    thus, in the promise that Jerusalem should remain constantly and permanently in an exalted condition, it is stated,” She will rise and sit in her place” (Zech 14:10); further,” He made the woman who was childless to sit as a joyful mother of children” (Psalms 113:9); i.e., He makes her happy condition to be permanent and enduring.
    When applied to God, the verb is to be taken in that latter sense: “You O Lord, remain (tesheb) for ever” (Lam. 5:19); “O You who sat (ha-yoshebi) in the heavens” (Ps. 123:1); “He who sits in the heavens
    i.e., He who is everlasting, constant, and in no way subject to change
    as He expressly declares, “I, the Lord, do not change” (Mal. 3:6); i.e., in Me there is not any change whatever. This idea is expressed by the term yashab when referring to God.
    The verb, when employed of God, is frequently complemented by “the Heavens,” inasmuch as the heavens are without change or mutation, that is to say, they do not individually change, as the individual beings on earth, by transition from existence into non-existence.
    We find, “Who sits over the circle of the earth” (Isa. 40:22), Who remains constantly and unremittingly over the sphere of the earth; that is to say, over the things that come into existence within that sphere

    Again, “The Lord sitteth upon the flood” (Ps. 29:10), i.e., despite the change and variation of earthly objects, no change takes place with respect to God’s relation (to the earth): His relation to each of the things which come into existence and perish again is stable and constant, for it concerns only the existing species and not the individuals. It should therefore be borne in mind, that whenever the term” sitting” is applied to God, it is used in this sense.
    "I saw then from the sound of the arrogant words that the horn spoke, I looked until the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and given to a flame of fire." [Verse 11]

    He was destroyed by the judgement of the ancient of days i.e God

    5TH NATION???

    13I saw in the visions of the night, and behold with the clouds of the heaven, one like a man was coming, and he came up to the Ancient of Days and was brought before Him. [Verse 13]


    Like a man..
    Now there were many nations
    One was LIKE A BEAST , other was LIKE A BEAR , another one was LIKE A LEOPARD
    They all were LIKE AN ANIMAL
    However the last nation like a man was compared to humans , the disbelievers are like wild animals , God also compared them to wild animals in the last verse of Jonah


    Like a man
    And Christians assert that this verse is about their God-Man , their refutation lies in the fact that this person was supposed to slay all these 4 beasts , Instead their deity was killed by the Romans i.e the 4th beast
    And furthermore the Angel explained that the creature like a man was a nation [Verse 27]

    And He gave him dominion and glory and a kingdom, and all peoples, nations, and tongues shall serve him; his dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not be removed, and his kingdom is one which will not be destroyed.

    He gave him...
    Him = people like a son of man

    his dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not be removed
    Islam will never be removed from the Muslims

    Note : The word nation and People is the same
    ANGEL EXPLAINS THE DREAM
    My spirit-I, Daniel-became troubled within its sheath, and the visions of my mind terrified me.
    I drew near to one of those standing [there], and I asked him the truth of all this, and he told it to me, and he let me know the interpretation of the matters.

    I drew to the one of the standing
    The angels are called standing ones, as it is said: (Zech. 3:7): "among these who stand by"

    [He said] "These huge beasts, which are four, are four kingdoms, which will arise from the earth"
    And the high holy ones will receive the kingdom, and they will inherit the kingdom forever and to all eternity."

    These are four kingdoms
    Here is a proof that these were kingdoms and not individuals

    And the high holy ones will inherit the kingdom forever
    This is similar to a statement in Matthew ascribed to 'Isa A.S "And another nation will inherit the kingdom (from the Jews)"

    till eternity
    No one will be its successor , they are the last chosen people of God

    Note : From next verse till verse 22 , Danyal A.S asked more about the 4th Beast/Nation , i will move to verse 23 where Angel answered him

    So he said, "The fourth beast [represents] a fourth kingdom [that] will be on the earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms, and it will devour the whole land and trample it and crush it.

    And the ten horns that [sprout] from that kingdom [represent] ten kings [that] will rise, and the last one will rise after them, and he will be different from the first, and he will humble three kings.
     [Verse 23-24]
    This is my explanation on an earlier verse which talked about ten horns , these are the ten kings of Rome that will arise after one another

    The angel further explains which is irrelevant to our argument
    And the judgment shall be established, and they will remove his dominion to be destroyed and annihilated until the end.
    And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under all the heavens will be given to the people of the high holy ones; its kingdom is a perpetual kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey [it]."
    [Verse 26-27]
    This is clear , Rome will be anhilated by the holy people and the holy people will inherit the kingdom and they will last forever

    The holy people historically would be no one but Muslims

    This is a short explanation of Chapter 7 of Daniel

    I am going offline for a long time [Weeks] after writing this , all of this took me more than an hour
