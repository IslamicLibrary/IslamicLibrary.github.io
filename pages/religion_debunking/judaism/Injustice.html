    The Rambam lays out criteria for a prophet 👇

    “Prophecy is bestowed only upon a very wise sage of a strong character, who is never overcome by his natural inclinations in any regard. Instead, with his mind, he overcomes his natural inclinations at all times. He must [also] possess a broad and correct perspective. A person who is full of all these qualities and is physically sound [is fit for prophecy].”

    Source:  "Guide for the Perplexed", Vol. ii, Chapters 36-46.

    If this is the case then a lot of prophets in the Tanakh have failed this criteria. Let’s look at the prophets down below and ask yourself if they fit this criteria

    Rashi says that Moses peace be upon him committed the sin of slander which is why God punished him with leprosy

    מצרעת כשלג LEPROUS AS SNOW — It is the nature of leprosy to be white, and thus we read in reference to a leper, (Leviticus 13:4) “If the bright spot be white [in the skin of his flesh]”. By this sign, too, he indicated that he had made a slanderous statement when he said, (v. 1) “But, behold, they will not believe me”. Therefore He smote him with leprosy (Exodus Rabbah 3:13) even as Miriam was so smitten for the slander she had spoken (cf. Shabbat 97a).
