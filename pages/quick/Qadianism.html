    18 - Mizra Ghulam Ahmad : Mizra Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian is a British-engineered false Prophet who appeared in India to quell resistance against the British colonialists. He claimed to be the Messiah as the similitude of Prophet 'Eessa, the Mahdi, a Prophet, a Messenger, and the second advent of Prophet Muhammad simultaneously. He invited his fiercest oppenent, Molvi Sanaullah Amratsari, to a prayer duel. He advertised his supplication to Allah pleading Him to annihilate the liar amongst the two in the lifetime of the truthful one, by Cholera or by Plague. He considered them to be the sign of Divine Anger and Punishment. Mirza subsequently died of cholera a year later.

    And my belief which I always affirm is that Islam has two parts. One is following Allah (swt) and second is following the Monarchy which created peace (for him) and which protected us from the Oppressers and that Monarchy is British Government.

    "Jesus's three paternal and maternal grandmothers were fornicators and prostitutes, from whose blood Jesus came into existence."
    (Anjam-i-Atham, Roohany Khazaen, Vol. 11, P. 291, addenda; Anjam-i-Atham, P. 9, appendix)

    Sahīh al-Bukhārī
    The last of all the Prophets (Muhammad (ﷺ))
    Narrated Abu Huraira:  Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "My similitude in comparison with the other prophets before me, is that of a man who has built a house nicely and beautifully, except for a place of one brick in a corner. The people go about it and wonder at its beauty, but say: 'Would that this brick be put in its place!' So I am that brick, and I am the last of the Prophets."
    Reference: Sahīh al-Bukhārī 3535

    Mirza Ghulam states:
    “God Almighty has disclosed to me repeatedly in my visions that a person of the name of Krishan, who appeared among the Aryas, was a chosen one of God and was a Prophet of his time. The expression Avatar which is current among the Hindus is in its essence synonymous with Prophet. There is a prophecy in Hindu scriptures that in the latter days an Avatar would appear, who will possess the qualities of Krishna and will be his reflection. It has been conveyed to me that I am that person. Krishan had two qualities; one, that he was Ruddar i.e. the slayer of wild beasts and swine, [evil characters] that is to say by reasoning and Signs; and, two, that he was Gopal i.e. the nourisher of cows, that is to say he was a helper of the virtuous through his spirit. Both of these are the qualities of the Promised Messiah and God has bestowed both of them upon me.”

    Tareekh E Mirza English Translation

    This book is a short historical account of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani written by Shaykh Sanaullah Amritsari, originally written in Urdu and now available in the English language. He was a contemporary of Mirza and clashed with the alleged prophet. The work includes the evolution of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad at different stages in his life. It also sheds light on his prophecies and his failure as a claimant of prophethood. May Allah accept this work and make it a means of guidance for the sincere.
