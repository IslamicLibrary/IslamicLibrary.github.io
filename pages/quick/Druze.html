    Refuting the belief of the Rasā’īl (Rasā’īl Al Hikmah)

    With historical evidences and scholars of the drūzīyyah such as “Shaykh Kasem Bader”, one of the law bearers of drūzīyyah, we know that there were 24 books in the Rasā’īl al hikmah.

    According to many other scholars of drūzīyyah and some historical archives of the Druze, Abdullah al tanūkhī organised 6 books only in oral traditions, which meant that 18 other books were lost into history and were possibly even “destroyed”.

    According to scholars such as David seddon, a popular scholar linked to darazi’s ideological beliefs, he states:

    “Druze believe in seven prophets: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, and Muhammad ibn Ismail ad-Darazi. They also have a special affinity with Shueib, or Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses”

    -A Political and Economic Dictionary of the Middle East. Routledge. p. 74

    While according to people like Moustafa Moukarim, he is labelled as a “renegade” and with further notices from people such as EJ brills, he is labelled as a “trait of Satan” for his so called “ignorance and arrogance”.

    Not only this however, but according to some historians, he labelled himself “the sword of the faith” and was labelled as a maniac who wanted power, and even the universal founder (hamza Ibn ‘Alī) coincidently “said” in the rasā’īl

    “Faith does not need a sword to aid it”

    Not only this, but al darāzī then went against Ibn ‘Alī (universal founder), which led to a spark in 1018 with 2 Druze groups, those who followed the “universal founder” and Those who followed “the sword of faith”.

    In 1018, Darazites affirmed and coincidently believed:

    “Universal reason became incarnated in Adam at the beginning of the world, was then passed from him to the prophets, then into Ali and hence into his descendants” — EJ brills

    However, according to people like Sammy Swayd, he was a heretic and the 1st of the religion of the “manifestation of god”, while according to other scholars such as David seddon, he is labelled as a “prophet” and subsisted with the beliefs of al Hakim.

    So the question relies,

    (1) was al darazi a heretic or was he not

    Funny rulings of the “Non Ignorant” Drūzī

    (1) mirrors are not allowed for them for “ego”
    (2) black is the only colour for dresses (obligation for a non ignorant drūzī)
    (3) money in banks = harām
    (4) names is disliked
    (5) they don’t eat meat (major disliked [that’s what I could find])

    Proof is from a Drūzī on SK
