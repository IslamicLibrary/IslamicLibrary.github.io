    <h1>Yazidism</h1>


    <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Yazidism/">https://www.ancient.eu/Yazidism/</a>


    Even though Yazidism and Islam share some similarities, the former diverges from the latter in terms of how Yazidis perceive God. While God is monotheistic, he is comprised of a Holy Trinity, which features the Peacock Angel ('Peacock Angel' is Tawusi Melek in Kurdish), Sheikh 'Adi, and Sultan Êzî. In the Trinity, 'Adi and Êzî are deified versions of their historical counterparts: Sheikh 'Adi is the Sufi mystic and preacher who taught the Yazidis' Kurdish ancestors his version of Islam, while Sultan Êzî is the Umayyad caliph Yazid ibn Mu'awiya. The Peacock Angel, however, is the chief member of the Holy Trinity. He is a manifestation of God and the ambassador to humanity, tasked with bestowing divine wisdom upon the Yazidi people every 1,000 years. As the leader of the Heft Sir (Seven Angels), the Peacock Angel and his subordinates are responsible for predetermining the future. Yazidis view him as the symbol of their faith. As the only earthly representative of God, he is deeply revered. The Yazidi Holy Trinity is the only way through which God can be observed, and the Trinity is the object of veneration. The Yazidi hymn 'Symbol of Faith', or Ședha Dînî, states:

    The testimony of my faith is One God,

    Sultan Sheikh 'Adī is my king,

    Sultan Ězî is my king,

    Tawûsî Melek is (the object of) my declaration and my faith.

    God willing, we are Yazidis

    Followers of the name of Sultan Ězîd.

    God be praised, we are content with our religion and our community.

    (Açıkyıldız, 71-72)

    While Yazidism's Holy Trinity distinguishes it from Islam, the greatest theological difference between the two faiths is how the Peacock Angel contrasts with the Islamic view of Satan. Yazidi oral tradition states that God ordered the Peacock Angel not to submit to other beings. God then tested his loyalty by creating Adam, the first man, from dust, and subsequently commanded the Peacock Angel to bow to Adam. However, the Peacock Angel refused, exclaiming, “How can I submit to another being! I am from your illumination while Adam is made of dust” (Williams). Consequently, God praised the Peacock Angel and made him his earthly representative. Thus, Yazidis interpret the Peacock Angel's rejection of Adam as the purest act of devotion to God.
