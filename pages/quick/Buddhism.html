    According to the Buddhist tradition, women cannot ascend to the status of a Buddha — one who is awake, enlightened and emancipated from samsāra, the cycle of birth and death — because their bodies grow and give birth to children. That ties them metaphorically to samsāra.

    Ancient text

    A passage from a popular 5th-century Buddhist text provides an extensive meditation on the reasons why a woman must transform her sex in order to become a Buddha:

    “As for a woman who is born inside the imperial palace, she necessarily belongs to another person. Throughout her life, she is like a maidservant who must serve and follow a great family, also like a disciple who must venerate and serve his master. She is beaten by different kinds of swords and staves, rocks and tiles, and is defiled by every evil word. These kind [sic] of sufferings deprive her of self-sovereignty. This is why a woman must give rise to the thought of abhorring and getting rid of her female body.”

    To attain Buddha status — the ultimate goal of the religion — a woman must become a man, by dying and being reborn. But in many Buddhist texts, an advanced practitioner of Buddhism might miraculously change her form, in this life, at her own will.

    “It is better for you to have put your manhood in the mouth of a venomous snake or a pit of burning charcoal than a woman.”

    “Of all the scents that can enslave, none is more lethal than that of a woman.”

    Further examples of negative portrayals of women in Buddhism are evident in both Mahayana and  Theravada literature. In both traditions hell is described as populated by elderly, repulsive women, a visualization monks are encouraged to undertake to deepen their understanding the impermanence of the body and beauty. Other negative portrayals of women include the following: “Pray, lord, what is the reason, what is the cause why women folk neither sit in a court [of justice], nor embark on business, nor reach the essence of [any] deed?”  The Buddha replied “Women  are  uncontrolled  Ananda.  Womenfolk  are  envious,  Ananda.  Women  folk  are  greedy, Ananda.  Women folk are weak in wisdom,  Ananda.  That is the reason, that is the cause why women folk do not sit in a court of justice, do not embark on business, do not reach the essence of the deed” (Anguttara Nikaya II: 82-83).
    Fools, lust for women like dogs in heat.  They do not know abstinence.  They are also like flies who see vomited food. Like a herd of hogs, they greedily seek manure.  Women can ruin the precepts of purity.  They can also ignore honor and virtue. Causing one to go to hell, they prevent rebirth in heaven.  Why should the wise delight in them? (Sponberg, 1992: 19)

    According to the Pali Vinaya and other early scriptures, the Buddha originally refused to ordain women as nuns. He said that allowing women into the sangha would cause his teachings to survive only half as long –- 500 years instead of a 1,000.
    Traditional Buddhist attitudes toward women associate the feminine with the sensual realm as opposed to the Dharma realm. Women are either depicted as lustful temptresses who threaten the spiritual welfare of monks or as the maternal source of man’s anguish and pain. One level of hell described in both Theravadin and Mahayana literatures depicts a realm which is populated by elderly, grotesquely formed women. This association of the temptress/seductress with the death of the spiritual being is also depicted by the daughters of Mara: Lust, Aversion, and Craving.

    A few passages from "The Tale of King Udayana of Valsa" from the Collection of Jewels illustrates the mon’s insecurities about women and their beliefs that women are the causes of evil and suffering.

    "Women can be

    The cause of great suffering.

    If desire is destroyed

    There will be everlasting happiness."

    "The dead snake and dog

    Are detestable,

    But women are even more

    Detestable than they are."

    The following quote is attributed to the Buddha.

    "The female’s defects- greed, hate, and delusion and other defilements- are greater than the male’s...You (women) should have such an intention... Because I wish to be freed from the impurities of the woman’s body, I will acquire the beautiful and fresh body of a man."

    Buddhism is one of the few religions which somehow escapes the wrath of the liberal world. In fact, a “New Atheist” as rabid and virulent as Sam Harris recommends some practices affiliated with Buddhism (namely, Dzogchen from the Tibetan tradition). We can easily guess why: Buddhism has often been perceived as atheistic, or at least […]

    Rupert Gethin claims that even within the Buddhist framework of dhamma, limited violence is allowed in certain contexts. The advice to rulers is to pass judgement not in haste or anger but appropriately, so  that the punishment fits the crime. If war is necessary, then care should be taken to minimize and contain the acts of violence. Buddhism accepted the idea that the duties of the king involved the implementation of a limited amount of violence for the purpose of deterring external enemies and to maintain law and order in the society. Even when violence on the part of the king becomes necessary, his mind must still be motivated by  aversion.The person killing must act out of compassion and charity, so  hat inner peace is not disturbed. Another argument within Buddhism is that since destiny is pre-determined, it is no sin to put someone to death. One sutta notes that someone who kills another person is not necessarily reborn in hell. In fact, at times, a soldier might be reborn in the  heavenly realm. This point seems to be taken from the Bhagavad Gita. In the Pali commentaries, the victim’s lack of virtuous qualities diminishes the burden of killing on the part of the person who kills . In one story from the Mahaparinirvana Sutra of Mahayana Buddhism, Buddha is said to have encouraged his followers to take up arms in defence of  the Buddhist Order.Having recourse to violence in order to protect the doctrine against aggressors is acceptable in the Buddhist framework. At  times, it is necessary to kill one in order to save two or more persons. It seems that Buddhism could justify defensive warfare, which can be categorized as a sort of dharmayuddha.
