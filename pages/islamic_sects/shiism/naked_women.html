    Many things are going to be covered here first the hadith in bukhari 364
    This hadith was before the divine revelation came down to him as in fathul bari as the prophet getting naked it
    means that he still didn’t have tashri’ second he was helping his uncle it was an accident also
    if you were to go to a doctor and show him your @ss to cure you would that be wrong
    No
    The second claim is in bukhari 374 except it was because of the wind
    The third claim is in a hadith in muslim where the prophet exposed his fakhd but it has a problem it is doubt
    of the narrator here fathul bari ibn hajar refutes it

    Lastly a claim

    {حَدَّثَنَا إِسْحَاقُ بْنُ أَبِي إِسْرَائِيلَ، حَدَّثَنَا حَمَّادٌ، حَدَّثَنَا حَنْظَلَةُ، عَنْ أَنَسٍ، أَنَّ امْرَأَةً أَتَتِ النَّبِيَّ فَمَسَحَ وَجْهَهَا، وَكَانُوا يَأْتُونَهُ فَيَمْسَحُ
    وُجُوهَهُنَّ وَيَدْعُو لَهُنَّ، فَقَالَتْ: يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ، طَأْطِئْ يَدَكَ، قَالَ: فَدَفَعَهَا، وَقَالَ: إِلَيْكِ عَنِّي}

    The prophet put his hands at women breasts but that is weak because of
    Hanzala
