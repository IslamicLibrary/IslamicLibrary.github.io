    A Common Shia argument regarding Umar ra is that he was "gay" and was one of the people that was turned out from the Prophet (ﷺ) -
    meaning the Prophet (ﷺ) chucked him out. This argument comes from poor translation and Arabic comprehension. So, the Hadith says:

    ‎حَدَّثَنَا مُسْلِمُ بْنُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، حَدَّثَنَا هِشَامٌ، حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى، عَنْ عِكْرِمَةَ، عَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ ـ رضى الله عنهما ـ قَالَ
    لَعَنَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم الْمُخَنَّثِينَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ، وَالْمُتَرَجِّلاَتِ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ، وَقَالَ ‏ "‏ أَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِنْ
    بُيُوتِكُمْ ‏"‏‏.‏ وَأَخْرَجَ فُلاَنًا، وَأَخْرَجَ عُمَرُ فُلاَنًا‏.‏

    Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:

    The Prophet (ﷺ) cursed the effeminate men and those women who assume the similitude (manners) of men. He also said, "Turn them out of your houses."
    He turned such-and-such person out, and `Umar also turned out such-and-such person. [1]

    Sahih al-Bukhari 6834 - Book 86, Hadith 59.

    Note:
    [1] Due to lack of reading comprehension, Arabic understanding and poor translation, Shia use this Hadith to say that Umar one of the "gay"
    people who was chucked out by the Prophet (ﷺ). If they even bothered to read the last line in the Arabic properly, they would read it as:

    ‎وَأَخْرَجَ فُلاَنًا، وَأَخْرَجَ عُمَرُ فُلاَنًا‏
    “Throw them out of your homes." So and so was expelled, and Umar expelled so and so."

    Meaning that the Prophet (ﷺ) said to throw them out of your homes, and Umar also did the same. It doesn't mean that Umar also turned-out
    "gay" as many Shia claim, it means that Umar also enforced what the Prophet (ﷺ) said to do.
