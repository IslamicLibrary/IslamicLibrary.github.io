    In the name of Allah ﷻ, most gracious, most merciful
    Blasphemies of Mirza


    1) HE CLAIMED THAT HE IS THE SON OF ALLAH

    Mirza Ghulam said "Allah spoke to me with His statement 'Listen, O my son'"

    Reading material: Al-Bushra 1/49

    2) HE CLAIMED THAT HE IS ALLAH

    Mirza Ghulam said "The Lord said to me, 'You are from Me and I am from you. Your appearance is My appearance'"

    Reading material: The Holy Revelation, Page 650

    3) HE CLAIMED THAT HE IS THE INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN ALLAH & THE CREATION

    He said: “Verily, Allah descended in me, & I am the intermediary between Him & all the creation.”

    Reading material: The Book of Creatures, Page 75

    4) HE CLAIMED THAT HIS HOMELAND OF QADIAN IS GREATER THAN MAKKAH & MADINAH

    Mirza said "Verily, Qadian is the Mother of Towns; whoever cuts it off will be cut and shredded. Thus, fear lest you be cut and shredded. The fruits of Makkah & Madinah have ceased but the fruits Qadian continue to be fresh"

    Reading material: The Reality of Dreams, Page 46.

    5) HE CLAIMED THAT HAJJ IS PERFORMED IN HIS HOMELAND OF QADIAN

    7) HE CLAIMED THAT ALLAH WAS BRITISH

    Mirza Ghulam said "I have been inspired with a number of inspirations in English. The last time I received inspiration in English. He said 'I do what I want'. So I thought, due to the accent and words, that He was British, standing at my head speaking"

    Reading material: Barahin Ahmadiyya, Page 480
