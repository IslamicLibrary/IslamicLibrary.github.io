    The false miracles of Rasheed khalifa (LA)

    God’s Miracle of 19 in Quran debunked

    I will go through the "miracles" on the website 19miracle.org:

    >Miracle 19 Fact #1. The first verse [(1:1)](<a href="http://masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch1.html">http://masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch1.html</a>), known as [“Basmalah,” consists of 19 letters ](<a href="http://masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact01.PDF)([Basmalah: image with letters marked](http://19miracle.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/basmalah2.jpg">http://masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact01.PDF)([Basmalah: image with letters marked](http://19miracle.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/basmalah2.jpg</a>)).

    Muhammad was illiterate, the Arabic letters are not a part of the revelation, they were made up later. And the number of letter depends on how you write it. Arabic writing has a problem that it doesn't write vowels. If they were smarter when designing Arabic writing, they would include vowels and the letter count would be higher. And in the case of basmala, the first word بسم has inconsistent spelling. Because in the verse 96:1, the same word is spelled as باسم. How do you know which spelling is right? If we chose the second which is equivalent, basmala would have 20 letters. Also the word الرحمن would be written as الرحمان in today's Arabic script. The alifs are a mess even within the Quran (see  [Spelling Inconsistencies in the Quran](<a href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Spelling_Inconsistencies_in_the_Quran">https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Spelling_Inconsistencies_in_the_Quran</a>)).

    >Miracle 19 Fact #2. [The Quran consists of 114 suras](<a href="http://www.masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact02.PDF">http://www.masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact02.PDF</a>), which is …………..19 x 6.

    Today's canonized Quran has 114 suras, but Muhammad's companions didn't know whether sura 9 (tawba aka baraa) is its own sura or only a continuation of sura 8 (anfal):

    >When an Ayah was revealed, he would say: "Put this Ayah in the Surah which mentions this and that in it." Now Al-Anfal was among the first of those revealed in Al-Madinah, and Bara'ah among the last of those revealed of the Qur'an, and its narrations (those of Bara'ah) resembled its narrations (those of Al-Anfal), so we thought that it was part of it. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, and it was not made clear to us whether it was part of it. So it is for this reason that we put them together without writing Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Rahim between them, and we put that with the seven long (Surahs).'" - [Tirmidhi  Vol. 5, Book 44, Hadith 3086](<a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/740920">https://sunnah.com/urn/740920</a>) - hasan

    If sura 9 is just a continuation of sura 8, then the Quran has only 113 suras.

    >Miracle 19 Fact #3. The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or ….19 x 334.

    The number of verses is not established, because Muhammad didn't specify clearly where verse ends and a new one starts, so the numbering is man-made. And the number 6346 goes against a [fatwa on islamweb](<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/84940/number-of-verses-in-quran">https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/84940/number-of-verses-in-quran</a>):

    >The numbers of the verses of Qur'an are a little more than 6200. All the scholars of Islam are agreed on the number 6200 but they differ regarding the remaining small number.Some say 4 verses. Others say fourteen. Others say nineteen. Others say twenty-five. Others say thirty-five or thirty-six.The reason for this disagreement is that the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) used to stop after reading the verse as to teach his companions the beginning and end of the verses.Some of them would consider any stop a beginning of a verse. Others would consider the stop only a breath and would link what preceded it to what follows it.Another reason for these differences is the lack of agreement on whether the Basmalah (Bismillahi Al-Rahmani Al-Rahim) is a verse of every Surah (chapter) or whether it was put there for its Baraka (blessing). al-Shafia consider it a verse of every Surah.

    Miracle 19 Fact #4. The Basmalah occurs 114 times, despite its conspicuous absence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27) & 114= 19x6.
    As was mentioned in the previous fatwa, it's not clear whether basmala is even a part of the revelation. If it was clearly a part of it, then it would be verse number 1 in all suras.
    Miracle 19 Fact #5. From the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27, there are precisely .......
    .....19 suras.
    27 = 9 + 18.
    Miracle 19 Fact #6. It follows that the total of the sura numbers from 9 to 27 (9+10+11+12+...
    +26+27) is 342, or .............19 × 18.
    It's not 19x19, so Allah failed in the second number.
    Miracle 19 Fact #7. This total (342) also equals the number of words between the two Basmalahs of
    Sura 27, and 342 = ........ 19 x 18.
    The first basmala is not a verse. It's just a thing written above verse 1.
    And looking at their counting list, there are corruptions in the counting. In verse 1 they don't count they mystery letters Taa Sin. Which is questionable. But a worse thing is in the verse 27:18 where they inconsistently count two words piaboud as one word while they count isseid as two words.
    So the word y meaning "not" is counted as a part of the verb pliaboy but when it occurs with the verb u9 i it's counted as a separate word. In verse 25 they also count two words as one word.. I don't even feel need to check the rest. This is not an innocent mistake, but obvious intentional deception. They hope that nobody will check it.
    Miracle 19 Fact #8. The famous first revelation
    (96:1-5) consists of ........19 words.
    Deception again. The "18th word" is actually two words of lo ("what not"). You can see on https:// quran.com/96/5 they are separate.
    Miracle 19 Fact #9. This 19-worded first revelation consists of 76 letters .19 x 4.
    It's not 19 worded. And yes it has 76 letters - but l'm not impressed by it.
    Miracle 19 Fact #10. Sura 96, first in the chronological sequence, consists of .... 19 verses.
    The numbering is man-made, but yes.
    Miracle 19 Fact #11. Miracle 19 Fact #11. This first chronological sura is placed atop the last ..19 suras.
    Miracle 19 Fact #12. Sura 96 consists of 304
    Arabic letters, and 304 equals .19 x 16.
    Lol. Basmala is verse number 0?? I haven't heard of verse number 0 in the Quran. And it's inconsistent with previous "miracles" that didn't count basmala as a verse. For example in miracle 10, if we add verse © (basmala), then the number of verses is 20.
    Besides that, the counting of letters seems to be correct. But only in the Hafs variant. For example in verse 96:9 (and 96:13), there is a variant reading, where Hafs says Que;i which has 5 letters, but Warsh says witi which has only 4 letters. So Allah failed in some of his other variants. In general, counting letters and words cannot be taken seriously unless it takes into consideration all qira'at.
    Miracle 19 Fact #13. The last revelation (Sura 110)
    consists of ......
    ...19 words.
    Fatwa on IslamQA says:
    There is no proven hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which states which was the last soorah of the Qur'aan to be revealed. This is why the Sahaabah differed and each of them said what his ijtihaad led him to.
    Also why don't you add the four words from verse zero (basmala)?
