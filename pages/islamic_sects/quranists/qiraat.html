    How the Qira’at Refute Quranists

    Premise 1: Qur'an is preserved.

    Premise 2: Qur'an has 10 Qira'at

    Premise 3: The Qira'at are not mentioned in Qur'an and can differ in meaning.

    Premise 4: If there are differences in meaning in Qira'at then how can you justify this(without hadith), as differences in meanings/recitations are not mentioned in the Qur'an at all.

    Premise 5: Then the Hadith rejector would have to:

    A.) Accept the Hadith of 7 modes which justify differences of meaning.

    OR

    B.) Deny the Qur'an preservation. This would go against clear-cut verses.


    Conclusion: Therefore the Qira'at destroy the Hadith rejection position.
