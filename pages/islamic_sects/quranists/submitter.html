    Submitters claim that a prophet is someone who receives words by god . So if rashad claimed to receive words from god then he would claim to be a prophet according to their definition hence he would be a prophet after Muhammad which contradicts the Quran
    Here’s a video of of rashad claiming to received words of god:

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rtDChfbGcMA">https://youtu.be/rtDChfbGcMA</a>

    Thus their definition is false according to their own sources. (Idk if rashads definition of a prophet is the same as the submitters definition)



    Nabi comes from word Naba’a (information). So a nabi is someone who informs the people what Allah wants him to inform and teach the people. Rasool comes from the word Risala (message). It means to send an emissary/ delegate/ representative/ ambassador. So a rasool is somebody whom Allah sends. And you send a delegate to a people whom you are not on friendly terms with. So a rasool is sent towards a disbelieving nation. Whereas a nabi teaches to a people who already accepts him.
    Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: ❝The correct view is that the Messenger is one who is sent to a disbelieving people, and the Prophet is one who is sent to a believing people to teach them and judge between them.❞
    - Sheikh Islam Ibn Tammiyah
    So the early understanding is that every messenger is a prophet, but not every prophet is a messenger, therefore last prophet means last messenger
