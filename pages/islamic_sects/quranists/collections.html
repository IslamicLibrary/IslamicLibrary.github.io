    <h1>Hadith Book in the 7th Century</h1>

    Folios of the Damascus manuscript of "Sahifat Hammam ibn Munbbih" صحيفة همام بن منبه, the earliest Hadith book for which we have manuscripts. It was written in the 7th century.

    ‎Hammam (660 - 719 AD) was a Tabi' تابعي and a student of Abu Hurairah (RA). He heard most (if not all) of the Hadiths he included in his book from Abu Hurairah (RA).
