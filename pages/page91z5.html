    The Incoherency of the Concept of God “Defeating Death”

    Credit to Ijaz Ahmed

    As a Muslim, respectfully here are a few reasons why I find these beliefs to be incredulous:

    • Can God be made to suffer? That is to say (regardless of the doctrines behind natures & persons) can the Most Powerful Being be compelled to experience pain & suffering from one of its own creation?

    • If God created death, what was victorious about God "defeating" His own creation? For example, if an adult man punches a baby, while we'd agree the adult was victorious, isn't there some ignominy in that "victory"? Would that be something to be celebrated?

    •If God did not create death, then that necessitates that death is co-eternal to God, resulting in two eternally existent beings (resulting in polytheism).

    • In Romans 6:9, it teaches that death once had mastery over Jesus who is God, how can one of God's creations have dominion & mastery over God Himself?

    • If the death of Christ  was meant to be a sacrifice, what exactly was sacrificed & to whom?

    Most responses to these questions aren't answers, they are simply repititions of "this is what we believe".  Merely repeating what your belief is, is not the same as explaining the reasons which make sense of the belief itself.

    Some will say that not all beliefs about God are meant to make sense to humans, thereby I would ask, are these specific beliefs about the resurrection meant to be unreasonable?

    If so, then how can any of us be blamed for refusing to accept them to begin with?
