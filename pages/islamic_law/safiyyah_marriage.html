    So the claim here is that the killed her father and her husband and same day and raped her then
    However that is false because her father was killed 3 years before because of his treason, her husband was killed at banu quraidha cause it was actual war
    with them the prophet didn’t know about him.

    And actually safiyahs life was pretty sad before she used to be hit in the face by her husband because she had a vision of marrying prophet muhammed
    Now did prophet muhammed leave her the choice to marry him or he raped her ?
    Translation: “The prophet chose saffiyah for himself and he gave her the choice either she goes back to her people and be free or she will marry him and
    she said I choose Allah and his apostle”

    -Source: Al-Ihsan fi taqrib Sahih ibn habban volume 10 page number 392 narration number 4530
    Grade: sahih (authentic) chain of transmission under the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim (al-arna’ut)

    There is another claim that she hated him but that is because she didn’t know what her parents had done after that she loved him even more
    Although the authenticity of the narration is disputed
    Narrated Anas bin Malik:We arrived at Khaibar, and when Allah helped His Apostle to open the fort, the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtaq whose husband
    had been killed while she was a bride, was mentioned to Allah's Apostle. The Prophet (ﷺ) selected her for himself, and set out with her, and when we reached
    a place called Sidd-as-Sahba,' Safiya became clean from her menses then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) married her. Hais (i.e. an 'Arabian dish) was prepared on a small leather mat.
    Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, "I invite the people around you." So that was the marriage banquet of the Prophet (ﷺ) and Safiya.
    Then we proceeded towards Medina, and I saw the Prophet, making for her a kind of cushion with his cloak behind him (on his camel).
    He then sat beside his camel and put his knee for Safiya to put her foot on, in order to ride (on the camel).

    -Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 4211
    Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim
    For the claim he bought saffiyah for 7 slaves
