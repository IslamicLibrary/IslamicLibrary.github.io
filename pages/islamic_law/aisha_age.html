    Shaykh Ibn 'Abd al-Barr  (May Allah be pleased with him) said: There is no differences of opinion and the Ulama all agree Aa'isha
    (May Allah be pleased with her) was 9 when the Prophet (peace and blessing of God be upon him) married her.

    Imam Ibn Kathir (rh) said: The 'Ulama all agree she was 9 when the Prophet (saw) married Aa'isha (ra). There is no difference of opinion amongst the 'Ulama on this matter.”

    Narrated Aa’isha (ra):

    that the Prophet (ﷺ) married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).

    [Sahih Bukhari 5133]

    Aa’isha (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that,

    Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) married her when she was seven years old, and she was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her;
    and when the Holy Prophet died she was eighteen years old.

    [Sahih Muslim 1422 b-C]

    Al-Bukhārī reports that Hishām [ibn ʿUrwa] narrates from his father that Aisha, may God be pleased with her, [said]: “The Prophet ﷺ married her when she was six years old and he
    consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years.”

    consumed that marriage when she was nine years old.”

    Let's look at some narrations from Sunan an-Nasa'i 👇

    It was narrated that 'Aishah said:
    "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine."

    Source: Sunan an-Nasa'i 3379


    It was narrated that 'Aishah said:
    "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."

    Source: Sunan an-Nasa’i 3378


    The hadith above state that Aisha was 6 when she married and 9 when the marriage was consummated. These narrations come from the three most authentic books in the Islamic
    tradition following the Quran, Sahih al Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and Sunan an-Nasa’i, not to mention that they place Aisha as the narrator.


    Allāmah Hāfidh bin Hajar al-Asqalāni Rahimahullāh states in “Sharh al-Nukhbah” that the Ulamā are unanimous in accepting Sahīh al-Bukhārī and Sahīh Muslim.

    ‎‏لا اتفاق العلماء بعدهما علي تلقي كتابيهما باالقبول

    ‎‏ (شرح النخبة، ص 62،دار البصائر)

    Allāmah Sakhāwī states in “Fath al-Mughīth” that Sahīh al-Bukhārī and Sahīh Muslim are the most authentic books of Hadīth.

    ‎‏وباالجملة فكتاباهما اصح كتب الحديث
    ‎‏(فتح المغيث، ج 1، ص 53، مكتبة دار المنهاج)

    In addition, numerous other authentic ḥadīths outside the Sahihayn support these two ages
    Not a single prominent medieval Islamic scholar took issue with her age; on the contrary, some of them went as far to say that there was a 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘀𝘂𝘀 (𝗶𝗷𝗺𝗮𝗮).

    🔹Ibn Hazm says: “The age of Aisha is recorded in the texts without a difference of opinion.”
    [Ibn Ḥazm, Ḥujjat-l-Widāʿ, 435]

    🔹Ibn Kathir says: “This is a matter in which there is no difference of opinion amongst people.”
    [bn Kathīr, al-Sīrat al-Nabawiyya, ii. 141]

    🔹Ibn Abd al-Barr says: “I do not know of anyone differing on this.”
    [Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr, al-Istīʿāb, iv. 1881]

    Thus, it can be concluded that the ages of 6 and 9 constitute the default understanding and any evidence that contradicts this will have to be equally or more authentic.

    Sahih Bukhari 476, Sunan at-Tirmidhi 2/409, Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Kitab: al-Nikah, Bab: Maa Jaa'a fee Ikraah Al Yateemah 'alaa al tazweej, Hadith no. 1027),
    Shaikh Abdur-Rahman Al- Mubarakpuri in his commentary on Sunan al-Tirmidhi said: Aisha knew (that she hit puberty) when she became nine years old.
    (Shaikh Abdur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri, Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi, Kitab: al- Nikah, Bab: Maa Jaa'a fee Ikraah Al Yateemah 'alaa al tazweej, Hadith no. 1027),
    Tareekh Dimashk by In Asaker (37/164), Tareekh Asbahan (2/243), Al-Firdaos bema thoor al-Dilmey (1253)
    "I have seen many girls in Yeman undergo menses (reach the age of puberty) at the age of nine." (Dhahabi, Siyar A'lam an-Nubala', Vol. 10, p. 91)
    "She was very well matured." (Nawawi, Sharh Muslim, Vol. 9, p. 206)
    “Aisha said: When the girl becomes 9 years old, she has become a woman.” (Tirmidhi 1109)

    The presentist Aisha argument historically fails. Aisha herself said she had hit puberty at 9 and that she was an adult. To affirm she is 9 while denying her pubescence and
    adulthood is confirmation bias.

    (However it may be possible she was off by a BIT due to the lunar calendar reaching the Arabs in 638 CE aka 15 years after the marriage)
