    Ibn Humam writes:
    It is necessary to punish apostasy with death in order to avert the evil of war, not as punishment for the act of unbelief, because the greatest punishment for that is with Allah.
    This punishment is specifically for those who wage war and this is for the man.For this reason, the Prophet prohibited killing women because they do not fight.

    Source: Fath ul-Qadeer volume 6 page number 68

    Also in the hanafi madhab women old people people who can’t fight children aren’t killed according to al-hawi al-kabir

    Hadith like Sahih al-bukhari 1883 Sunan an-nasa’i 4048 prove our point

    Imam al-buti rh said if he doesn’t fight us we don’t kill him in his book al-jihad
    Page number 212 where he defines to cases of apostasy the non fighter is treated as a normal kaffir where he isn’t killed also not forced to Islam (2:256)
    The prophet never forced anyone to follow his religion like ibn al-Qayim said, al-Shāfī’ī adds some people have believed then disbelieved but the prophet didn’t kill them the prophet never
    killed any apostate

    So in conclusion if the apostate leaves Islam for himself nothing happens to him but if he wants to cause treason and try to get Muslims out of their religion there he is stopped and asked to
    repent for 3 days. For this you can check Qūr’ān 3:72 at last this is also present in your book Deuteronomy 13:6-10 and you can pali for quotes from church fathers about this and if you’re an
    atheist you have no moral bases to judge byIbn Humam writes:

    This shows that "apostasy" wasn't merely just leaving Islam and in the apostasy wars, they weren't fighting people who left Islam but those who fought against the ruler
    which would be punished in any state. Also there's many people who worshiped God and were Muslims but were considered apostates because they repelled against the ruling government in Medina.

    Ibn Hazm said:

    ومنهم من قال : بالاستتابة أبدا وإيداع السجن فقط كما قد صح عن عمر

    „Some of them held the opinion that apostates should be given all the time to repent and to keep them in prison, as it is well established from ‘Umar.“
    HA

    He also said وَطَائِفَةٌ قَالَتْ: يُسْتَتَابُ أَبَدًا، وَلَا يُقْتَلُ.

   An-Nawawi (d. 676 A.H) said:

  وقال الثوري يستتاب أبدا ويحبس إلى أن يتوب أو يموت.

  „And al-Thawri said that he (the Murtad) is called to repent forever and he will be imprisoned until he repents or dies.“

  Abu Hayyan al-Andalusi (d. 745 A.H) said about the issue of killing the Murtad:

  „As for his Hukm with regards to killing, an-Nakha'i and al-Thawri said: he [the Murtad] is called to repent in prison forever.

  „Anyone who is not allowed to be killed because of his original disbelief is also not allowed to be killed for apostasy.
  The reason why the (male) apostate is prescribed to be killed is because of his capability to wage war.“

  Ibn-e-Qayyim (700 AH), of the Hanbali school of thought, wrote:

  ‘As for the punishment of execution, it is reserved for the greatest offenses such as those against life, so that its punishment is of similar kind,
  such as the offense against the religion by assaulting it and apostatizing from it.
  This offense is the first to be punished by execution in order to restrain the aggression of the criminal by every punishment but if he
  imprisoned his evil and closed his mouth and accepted Allahs laws on him there is no danger between the Muslims for his staying.’

  “And from it is that the punishement of the murtad (apostate) is one of the biggest interest that goes back to Muslims because in that
  there preservation and protection for the Muslims because without that if we leave apostasy with No punishment then many of the weak
  religiously Muslims would also leave their faith”
