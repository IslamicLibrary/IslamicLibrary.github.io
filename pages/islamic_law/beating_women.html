    Aa'isha (ra) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) never beat anyone with his hand, neither a woman nor a servant, but only,
    in the case when he had been fighting in the cause of Allah and he never took revenge for anything unless the things made inviolable by Allah were made violable;
    he then took revenge for Allah, the Exalted and Glorious.
