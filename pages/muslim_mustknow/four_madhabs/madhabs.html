    1  which madhab would be easy to learn which would depend on ur family mosques in your area and the madhab of ur country / region and where u live and
    if u are revert/covert and u live where there no muslims then study wts easiers or who coverted u.
    Easiest would be hanafi due to it being biggest and more resources online but shafi has also became easier online.

    2 means . Again madhab of ur country /region / scholars in your area but if u have none of this and u for example live in middle of America and  no scholars no mosques not a muslim country then Most easiest would be hanafi due to it being biggest and more resources online but shafi has also became easier online and website like seekersguidance
    <a href="https://seekersguidance.org/">https://seekersguidance.org/</a> would be useful, as its best online fatwa website for the western world ive seen also there Dar al-Ifta al Misriyyah
    <a href="https://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/Module.aspx?Name=aboutdar">https://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/Module.aspx?Name=aboutdar</a>   Al-Azhar University, so thats good but seekers guidance better for western world as most of it scholars will give fatwa under situation of someone living there but also someone in Muslim country .

    Shaykh 'Umar Barakāt (رضي الله عنه) states:

    "It is permissible for one to do Taqlīd of each of the four Imāms [in all of the issues]. Likewise it is permissible for one to do Taqlīd of one of them in one issue, and do Taqlīd of another Imām on another issue, for it is not necessary to do Taqlīd of only one of them in all issues."
