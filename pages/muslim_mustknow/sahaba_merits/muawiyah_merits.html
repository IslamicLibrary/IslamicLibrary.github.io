    “the Prophet (ﷺ), that he said to Mu'awiyah: "O Allah, make him a guiding one, and guide (others) by him."

    Abū Bakr al-Khalāl (d. 311 AH) narrates:

    “-659: Muhammed bin Abi harūn and muhammed bin ja’far told me that Abu Al-Harith narrated to them that
    he said we faced a lot to Abū ʿAbdillāh what do you say about one  who says: I don’t believe that Muʿāwiyah is
    a scribe of revelation and I do not say that he is the maternal uncle of the believers and he took it (I.e caliphate)
    by the sword (I.e by sword) there upon Abū ʿAbdillāh said: that is a bad disgusting saying, they’re left alone (I.e those people)
    and they’re not to be sat with and we expose them to people. [4]
    -660: Abū Bakr b. Aḥmad al-Marwazī told us that he said to Abū ʿAbdillāh who is better: Muʿāwiyah or
    ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz Abū ʿAbdillāh said: Muʿāwiyah is better, we don’t compare the companions to the messenger
    of Allāh :HOP_FoA_SAW:  to someone because the prophet (:HOP_FoA_SAW: ) said: "The best people are those living in my generation” [5]

    [4]: isnād: Ṣaḥīḥ and without a doubt that Muʿāwiyah (May Allah be pleased with him) is a noble companion
    (of the prophet :HOP_FoA_SAW: ) and a scribe of revelation and he is the brother of Umm Ḥabībah Umm al-Mu'minin
    (mother of the believers may Allāh be pleased with her).

    [5]: isnād: Ṣaḥīḥ.”
