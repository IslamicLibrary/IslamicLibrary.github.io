    'A'isha reported:
    I said: Allah's Messenger, the kahins used to tell us about things (unseen) and we found them to be true. Thereupon he said: That is a word
    pertaining to truth which a jinn snatches and throws into the ear of his friend, and makes an addition of one hundred lies to it.

    Source: á¹¢aá¸¥Ä«á¸¥ Muslim 2228 a grade: á¹¢aá¸¥Ä«á¸¥

    'Urwa reported from 'A'isha that she said that people asked Allah's Messenger (ï·º) about the kahins. Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said to them:

    It is nothing (i. e. it is a mere superstition). They said: Allah's Messenger, they at times narrate to us things which we find true.
    Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said: That is a word pertaining to truth which a jinn snatches away and then cackles into the ear of his friend as the hen does.
    And then they mix in it more than one hundred lies.
