    What some academics say about the Quran’s preservation:

    Stanley Lane Poole:
    “It is an immense merit in the Quran that there is no doubt as to its genuineness, that very word we can now read with full confidence that it has remained unchanged through nearly thirteen hundred years.”

    - Edward William Lane and Stanley Lane Poole, Selections from the Kur-an, London: Trubner, 1879, p.c

    John Burton:
    “the text which has come down to us in the form in which it was organized and approved by the Prophet. What we have today in our hands is the Mushaf of Muhammad.”

    - John Burton, The Collection of the Quran, рр.239-40

    Thomas Arnold:
    “there is a general agreement by both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars that the text of this recension substantially corresponds to the actual utterances of Muhammad himself.”

    - Thomas Walker Arnold, The Islamic Faith, Lahore: Vagar Publications, 1983, p.9

    Philip Hitti:
     “Modern critics agree that the copies current today are almost exact replicas of the original mother-text as compiled by Zayd, and that, on the whole, the text of the Koran today is as Muhammad produced it. As some Semitic scholar remarked, there are probably more variations in the reading of one chapter of Genesis in Hebrew than there are in the entire Koran.”

    - Philip Hitti, History of the Arabs, London: Macmillan, 1937, p. 123

    R. V. C. Bodley:
    “Today there is no possible doubt that the Koran which is read wherever there are Moslems is the same version as that translated from Hafsa’s master copy.”

    - R. V. C. Bodley, The Messenger: The Life of Mohammed, New York: Greenwood Press, 1969, p.235
