    Methods of preservation:

    1) Oral Preservation
    The Arabs at the time of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) were known to be very good memorisers. Additionally, the Companions had a simple way of life, they were also known to have a very good memory and were able to quickly memorise things, as well as being very intelligent. During the prophets life time, many people aimed to learn the whole Quran and memorise it, and they did. So much so, that the companions were frequently asked to recite random parts of the Quran, from memory, and they did so. Also, the Quran was read in the daily prayers, at Jumaa prayers, among the Companions, by both the young and the old, and by men and women. Thus, it was easier to memorize it. Surat Al-Fatiha for example, was recited at least 5 times a day, every single day.


    2) Preservation via writing (Textual)
    During the Prophet's (SAW) time revealing the Quran, the verses were written by (specialized) scribes on accessible materials. Some of these materials include things such as Parchment (Animal Skin), Bones, and other material which was available. These scribes were extremely careful when writing down the Quran to prevent mistakes. These writings, were then copied by other scribes, and so on.
